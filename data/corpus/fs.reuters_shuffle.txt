china daily says vermin eat 7 - 12 pct grain stocks a survey of 19 provinces and seven cities showed vermin consume between seven and 12 pct of china 's grain stocks , the china daily said . it also said that each year 1.575 mln tonnes , or 25 pct , of china 's fruit output are left to rot , and 2.1 mln tonnes , or up to 30 pct , of its vegetables . the paper blamed the waste on inadequate storage and bad preservation methods . it said the government had launched a national programme to reduce waste , calling for improved technology in storage and preservation , and greater production of additives . the paper gave no further details .  
usda seeks comments on grain discount schedule the u.s. agriculture department is seeking public comments on the question of adjusting the commodity credit corporation 's ( ccc ) discount and premium schedules to improve the quality of grain it accepts as loan collateral or under price support programs . the premiums and discounts schedule are based on quality factors such as moisture content and kernel damage . the schedule stipulates the premiums and discounts used for valuing grain the ccc accepts or purchases during the year . the department said it is possible that producers could be encouraged to delivery higher quality grain to ccc by adjusting the premiums and discounts . comments are due by april 24 and a report to congress is required by law by may 10 .

bulgaria , romania grain crop seen less favorable current prospects for this year 's grain crop in bulgaria and romania appear less favorable than in 1986 , the u.s. agriculture department 's officer in belgrade said in a field report . the report said the assessment was based on travel in the two countries from march 30 to april 4 . it said crop conditions were better than earlier expected following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the prolonged winter temperatures this spring . however , in general plant development was at least three weeks or more behind normal this spring , and conditions varied greatly by regions , the report said . fields seeded during the optimum period last fall , and especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water ( about 65 pct of the fields observed ) , appeared to be in good condition , with little evidence of winterkill , while others varied considerably , the report said . fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and uneven stands . spotty germination and winterkill in those fields averaged 10 to 30 pct , it said .  
u.s./soviet grain meeting unlikely this summer prospects appear slim for a summer meeting between u.s. and soviet officials before the two countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains agreement , agriculture department officials said . the two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up to last february . however , any delay this year should not endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends through september , 1988 , usda officials said . " it will be difficult to pull together the people for the meeting during july , " an aide to usda undersecretary daniel amstutz said . since the last meeting was only around four months ago , the next talks could still be a " couple more months , " he said .   there has been grain industry speculation that the usda will offer moscow another wheat subsidy during the next marketing year . but usda officials said even if consultations were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made . " i doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer or before the next agreement year begins , " a usda source said . citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next year 's crops , he said , " there are too many variables now . it would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now . " under the nonbinding pact , moscow has agreed to purchase a minimum of nine mln tonnes of u.s. grain per year . soviet and u.s. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of a new agreement year to discuss grain quality , shipping logistics and production outlooks .  
soviet 1988 grain target indicates 1987 output recent announcements from moscow of next year 's grain production targets indicate that the soviets are estimating this year 's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes , agriculture department analysts said . usda is projecting the soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes , but some earlier estimates from soviet officials were that the 1987 grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes . moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on monday , putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes . an analyst of soviet agriculture at usda noted that a recent article in izvestia said soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be " 25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year . " " this indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213 mln tonne ( grain ) crop , " the analyst said .   in calculating moscow 's crop estimate , usda used the 235 mln tonne production goal , as well as a 238 mln tonne figure published in a soviet economic journal this month . usda 's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes , a usda source said . late season rains damaged soviet crops , slowed harvest progress and lowered soviet production , analysts said . while in the u.s. earlier this month , soviet agriculture official viktor nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be as good or better than last year 's 210 mln tonne harvest . a member of nikonov 's party commented that although 230 mln tonnes of grain were in the fields , harvest problems would bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes .

u.s. grain carloadings fall in week u.s. grain carloadings totaled 26,108 cars in the week ended february 21 , down 2.2 pct from the previous week but 22.8 pct above the corresponding week a year ago , the association of american railroads reported . grain mill product loadings in the week totalled 11,382 cars , down 1.8 pct from the previous week but 7.6 pct above the same week a year earlier , the association said .  
gao likely to show certs more costly than cash a study on grain certificates due out shortly from the government accounting office ( gao ) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays , administration and industry sources said . analysis that the gao has obtained from the agriculture department and the office of management and budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments , a gao official told reuters . gao is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of sen. jesse helms ( r - n.c. ) , former chairman of the senate agriculture committee . the report , which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash , is scheduled to be released in mid march . the cost of certificates , said the gao source , depends on the program 's impact on the usda loan program . if gao determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures , then the net cost of the program would go up . however , if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease , the cost effect of certificates would be less . gao will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded , the gao official said . but a negative report on certificates " will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program , " an agricultural consultant said . the omb is said to be against any expansion of the program , while usda remains firmly committed to it .  
soviet grains seen entering spring on shaky note soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter , weather and crop analysts said . prospects for another near - record grain harvest in the soviet union appear dim at this point , but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems , analysts said . but the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the soviet grain supply and future buying plans , analysts of the soviet union said . " from a weather standpoint , you can say with certainty that the soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop ( than last year ) , " gail martell , chief meteorologist for e.f. hutton said . the next six weeks in the ussr 's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops , martell and other analysts said . " where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us , " an agriculture department authority on the ussr said . the soviet union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill . this would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years , the usda analyst said . with a timely spring , soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops , but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30 - 35 pct lower . normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures . this winter , however , snowcover in soviet grain areas has generally been excellent , so the bulk of winterkill , analysts speculate , likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination . " fall dryness may be a problem . there 's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness , " martell said . precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern ukraine , and below normal over the entire winter crop area , she said . recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice - crusting and winterkill , jim candor , senior forecaster for accu weather , said . livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter , analysts said . the dry fall damaged pastures , the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off - pasture feeding , they said . " the soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they do n't have to buy ( grains ) now
u.s. congress to look at soil program exemptions the senate agriculture committee is expected to take up a bill tomorrow that would exempt from government conservation regulations those farmers who have rotated alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes with row crops , committee staff said . under current so - called " sodbuster " law , farmers who planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes on highly erodible land in the years 1981 through 1985 lose federal farm program benefits if they produce a row crop on that land in later years . sen. edward zorinsky ( d - neb . ) , sponsor of the measure , said recently that those crop rotating practices resulted in less erosion than the practices of many farmers who produced strictly row crops .  
izvestia says soviet winter crops need reseeding the government daily izvestia said a considerable amount of soviet winter crops need to be reseeded and the state 1987 grain harvest target of 232 mln tonnes will not be easy to fulfil . without giving figures , the newspaper said : " a considerable part of the winter crops must be reseeded , but that creates extra effort in the fields in spring . " the soviet union has previously said nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill . a u.s. department of agriculture analyst in washington has said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in 10 years . " the planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes of grain is not simple , " izvestia said . this week 's sudden fall in temperatures has affected large parts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in the ukraine , it said , adding that temperatures fell to as low as minus 30 centigrade in byelorussia .  
u.s. senate panel makes conservation exemption the u.s. senate agriculture committee approved a measure that would exempt farmers who planted alfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and 1985 from a federal conservation requirement . sen. edward zorinsky , d - neb . , said his bill would restore equity under federal sodbuster rules , which currently deny farm program benefits to farmers who , between 1981 and 1985 , planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes without interrupting the plantings with a row crop . an official from a leading conservation group , who asked not to be identified , said the panel 's move was " an unfortunate first action " because it could lead to the exemption of potentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations , established under the 1985 farm bill .  
renewal of u.s./ussr grain pact said uncertain prospects for renewal of the five - year u.s./ussr grains agreement are uncertain at this point , a soviet trade official told reuters . the current trade imbalance between the united states and the soviet union , high u.s. commodity prices , and increased world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement next year less certain , albert melnikov , deputy trade representative of the soviet union , said in an interview . the current agreement expires on sept 30 , 1988 . melnikov said that world grain markets are different than when the first agreement was signed in 1975 . statements from both u.s. and soviet officials have indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as attractive for both sides as it once was . " we have had one agreement . we have had a second agreement , but with the second agreement we 've had difficulties with prices , " melnikov said . " i can not give you any forecasts in response to the future about the agreement .... i do not want to speculate on what will happen after sept 30 , 1988 , " he said . melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from soviet government officials that they would be pushing for a renewal of the agreement . " the situation is different in comparison to three , five or ten years ago ... we can produce more , " he said .  
u.s. cabinet council set to mull farm issues the reagan administration 's cabinet - level economic policy council is scheduled to meet friday to discuss , among other issues , the status of agricultural legislation , administration officials said . the officials said discussion of a u.s. agriculture department wheat export subsidy to the soviet union was not on the agenda . matters not on the agenda , however , can be brought before the council , the officials said . grain trade officials have speculated that usda would make a wheat export enhancement offer to moscow , but usda officials have said the matter is not under active consideration . usda today transmitted to congress a package of legislative proposals , including bills that would cut target prices and speed up loan rate reductions .

sweden 's boliden to open saudi arabian gold mine mining group boliden ab said it had agreed with saudi state agency general petroleum and mineral organisation ( petromin ) to open a gold mine in saudi arabia to exploit one of the world 's richest deposits of the metal . boliden spokesman goran paulson told reuters the swedish group would   be responsible for the technical side of the operation and would have no control over the product itself . he said one option under discussion for refining the gold ore would be to ship it to boliden 's ronnskar copper smelter in northern sweden . paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it was strategically important since it increased boliden 's presence in saudi arabia . " representatives from petromin have visited ronnskar already ... we see saudi arabia as the expansion area of the future , " he said . the new mine , which is being developed at mahd adh dhahab in the west of the country and should open in the first half of 1988 , would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore , he said . boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in saudi arabia , but the new venture will be the first saudi mine to open in modern times .

sumitomo bank aims at quick recovery from merger sumitomo bank ltd & lt;sumi.t > is certain to lose its status as japan 's most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the heiwa sogo bank , financial analysts said . osaka - based sumitomo , with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen , merged with heiwa sogo , a small , struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans , in october . but despite the link - up , sumitomo president koh komatsu told reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position . " we 'll be back in position in first place within three years , " komatsu said in an interview . he said that while the merger will initially reduce sumitomo 's profitability and efficiency , it will vastly expand sumitomo 's branch network in the tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak . but financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off . some said sumitomo may have paid too much for heiwa sogo in view of the smaller bank 's large debts . others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch . the analysts agreed the bank was aggressive . it has expanded overseas , entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition , but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves . " they 've made bold moves to put everything in place . now it 's largely out of their hands , " said kleinwort benson ltd financial analyst simon smithson . among sumitomo 's problems are limits placed on its move to enter u.s. securities business by taking a share in american investment bank goldman , sachs and co. sumitomo last august agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank , but for the time being at least , the federal reserve board has forbidden them to exchange personnel , or increase the business they do with each other . " the tie - up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the fed was stricter than sumitomo expected , " said one analyst . but komatsu said the move will pay off in time . " u.s. regulations will change in the near future and if so , we can do various things . we only have to wait two or three years , not until the 21st century , " komatsu said . komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home . article 65 of the securities and exchange act , japan 's version of the u.s. glass - steagall act , separates commercial from investment banking . but the walls between the two are crumbling and komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities .

proxmire outlines insider trading legislation senate banking committee chairman william proxmire ( d - wis ) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders . speaking to the national association of manufacturers , proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that congress will act to curb abuses . " we are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure , would be fairer to all shareholders , and would insure that takeovers are properly financed , " he said . among the provisions , the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the securities and exchange commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days , proxmire said . in addition , there would be a pre - notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the sec . proxmire said the pre - notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts . proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the williams act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days . his bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer . to correct abuses in the financing of takeovers , proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced . the federal reserve board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock , but proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers . rather , the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money , proxmire said . he said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the federal reserve 's 50 pct margin requirements . the bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover . " when pickens and icahn get together we want people to know about it , " proxmire said . proxmire said he favored the approach used in britain towards two - tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment . he said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills . proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the senate committee would act this spring . he said he was hopeful congress could pass a bill this year .

soviet union sets 4.5 pct industrial output growth soviet planning chief nikolai talyzin told the supreme soviet ( parliament ) industrial output is planned to rise by 4.5 pct in 1988 , up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987 . in the first nine months of this year , industrial output rose by 3.6 pct . talyzin said national income , the nearest soviet equivalent to gross national product , is planned to rise by 4.3 pct against a planned 4.1 pct this year . he said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in 1988 , compared with a planned 232 mln this year . the soviet union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986 and the soviet press has said heavy rain has affected the harvest this year . talyzin said the 1988 soviet plan stressed the engineering industry , which kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev has described as a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if the soviet union is to compete effectively on world markets .

wojnilower sees drop in u.s. interest rates the federal reserve will promote lower interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth , first boston corp managing director albert wojnilower said . as much as the fed would like to take a tough line against inflation , it can not act to slow the growth of credit without subverting national u.s. economic policy . " on selected occasions when the dollar seems steady , and , because the trade deficit is not responding , the united states decided to push germany and japan harder to meet their commitments to economic growth , the federal reserve will do its part by moving rates down , " wojnilower said in a report . " justifiably not anticipating either a recession or seriously higher interest rates , securities market participants have seen little to fear , " wojnilower said . he said last week 's " hiccup " in money and currency rates and bond and stock prices was probably caused by japanese window dressing for march 31 end - of - fiscal - year accounts . wojnilower said the u.s. probably enjoyed above - average economic growth in the first quarter . however , the pick - up seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross national product growth of about 2 - 1/2 pct , he said .  
german bankers ' remarks revive talk of rate cut remarks by two leading central bankers sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in the west german three pct discount rate may be under discussion , currency dealers said . bundesbank board member claus koehler said in a speech that monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows required cuts in interest rates . separately , west berlin state central bank president dieter hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct . he made clear that he was not making a forecast on interest rates , however . currency dealers here and in the far east said the dollar gained slight background support from the speculation . but german dealers noted that the bundesbank kept the 3.80 pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money market this week , dashing some expectations that it may either offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate and let the strength of banks ' demands set the allocation rate . it allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity , much less than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact expired . this further weakened sentiment the bundesbank could move to a more accommodative monetary stance , dealers said . koehler said in a speech in surrey , england , speculative capital inflows may cause monetary growth , regardless of whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell . " in other words , the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity . " though koehler was known to be the most liberal of the generally monetarist bundesbank board , his comments marked the first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth , dealers said . reuter^m

lawson says some countries could cut rates nigel lawson , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability . speaking to journalists one day after the group of seven countries reaffirmed goals set in paris six weeks ago , he said central banks would continue to intervene " as and when necessary . " he said the g-7 countries were concerned that japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa yesterday . lawson said he was still worried about   the risk of a simultaneous recession in the united states , japan and west germany , though less so than when he gave his march 17 budget speech to the british parliament . " if anything i 'm a little bit less concerned , but there is still a risk , " he said . asked if the united states should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar , he said , " if there is a need for changes in relative interest rates , it does n't need to be a rise in interest rates in the united states . " lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday 's meetings at the slow progress the united states had made in reducing its budget deficit . " we believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year . the important thing is that it continue year after year , " lawson said . the february 22 louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then - current exchange rates . in the six weeks that followed the japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention . asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the louvre accord , he said , " i do n't think so . if there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness . " although intervention could be a cause of inflation , lawson said , " the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode ... but one has to be vigilant . " he said yesterday 's g-7 statement , which affirmed that " current levels " of exchange rates were appropriate , had been " carefully worded . " " we know what we mean , and we all mean the same thing , " he said . lawson said financial markets seem to believe that japanese measures outlined in the louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement . therefore , the g-7 countries welcomed miyazawa 's presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand . they particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending , but lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of

japan has no plans to cut discount rate bank of japan sources said the bank has no plans to cut its discount rate . they told reporters that there was no pressure on japan during the group of seven ( g-7 ) meeting here yesterday to lower its discount rate . they added that they themselves do not feel any need for a cut at all . chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson told reporters earlier today that some countries - those with strong currencies - might have to cut interest rates . the bank of japan sources also said that it was too soon to call the g-7 pact a failure . the central bank sources were commenting on the dollar 's renewed tumble in new york and tokyo , which was sparked by remarks by u.s. treasury secretary james baker that the dollar 's fall had been orderly . they said the market must have misinterpreted baker 's comments because he was referring to the dollar 's fall since the plaza agreement in september 1985 , over a long - time span , not the currency 's recent movements . they added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or the other . the bank of japan sources said the u.s. is putting more weight on the dollar / yen rate in terms of judging market stability than on other currencies . throughout the g-7 meeting , japan pointed to the dangers that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would reduce the flow of japanese capital to the u.s. , hurting the u.s. and world economies , they said . in february and in march of this year , japanese investors reduced their purchases of u.s. treasury bonds , the sources said . each country in the g-7 - britain , canada , france , italy , japan , the u.s. and west germany - has a different view about currency stability , the bank of japan sources said . this is because the overall foreign exchange market is a triangle of dollar / yen , european currencies / yen and dollar / european currencies . at the time of the louvre agreement , european countries did not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did not object to the yen strengthening , they said .

cocoa exporters expected to limit sales major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices , sources close to a meeting of the cocoa producers alliance ( cpa ) said . the sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member cpa which began on monday . they said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices . major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in london last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon . prices , under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses , recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules . the buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre - set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise . " the world 's cocoa price at present is just not interesting , " commented one delegate representing a major cpa producer . another source said that with much of the 1986/87 ( october - september ) world cocoa crop sold , limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next year 's harvest . the sources noted , however , that the cocoa industry in brazil , the world 's number two producer , is in private hands . this means limiting sales is more difficult than in major west african producers , where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards . the cpa includes the world 's top three producers , ivory coast , brazil and ghana , and accounts for 80 pct of all output . the meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening .

" the cocoa market is completely free . unlike coffee , which is controlled through export registrations , cocoa exporters in brazil operate at their own free will , " a trade source said . the traders were responding to questions whether they would follow the example of cpa members meeting in yaounde . the sources said the banco do brasil 's foreign trade department , cacex , never interferes in the cocoa market by rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment criteria . " the position of local producers is always to negotiate as they please . if they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think it 's a good deal , they are free to go ahead , " one source added .

dutch cocoa processors unhappy with icco buffer dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with the intermittent buying activities of the international cocoa organization 's buffer stock manager , industry sources told reuters . " the way he is operating at the moment is doing almost nothing to support the market . in fact he could be said to be actively depressing it , " one company spokesman said . including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on friday , the total amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes . despite this buying , the price of cocoa is well under the 1,600 special drawing rights , sdrs , a tonne level below which the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market . " even before he started operations , traders estimated the manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 sdr level , and yet he appears reluctant to do so , " one manufacturer said . " we all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period , and then simply step back , " he added . " the way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the market because everyone is holding back from both buying and selling waiting to see what the manager will do next , " one processor said . " as long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is likely to stay in the doldrums , and i see no indication he is about to alter his methods , " he added . processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock buying for some time to come .  
brazil not selling to cocoa buffer stock - trade brazil is not selling cocoa beans to the international cocoa organization , icco , buffer stock , as spot prices for beans in the interior area are 20 to 25 pct higher than levels which would be paid by the icco buffer stock manager , trade sources in the major producing state bahia said . the scarcity of beans because of the effects of drought on the current temporao harvest has pushed prices well above international levels , the sources noted . the only buyers are bean exporters or local processors covering previously contracted commitments , they added . if sales were made they would be executed by individual exporting companies which are members of the brazilian cocoa trade commission , they said .  
cocoa origins dismayed by buffer stock action traders recently returned from west africa say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action so far by the international cocoa organization ( icco ) buffer stock manager on buffer stock purchases . one trader said some west african producers are annoyed the buffer stock manager is not playing his part as required by the international cocoa pact to stabilise prices from current lows . so far , only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this , traders noted , only on an intermittent basis . they noted the purchases , of 8,000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13,000 in the second , are well short of the limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him . the traders recently returned from west africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far , noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers . london traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the icco 10-day average indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point ( or reference price ) . however , little progress has been made in that direction , and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously . the buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow , although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic , traders said . complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to west african producers , they observed . a reuter report from rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities . in london , traders expressed surprise that no more than 21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes . carryover holdings from the previous international cocoa agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes . terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from friday 's close , basis july at its high of 1,271 . it seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from the market , prices go up , while when he declares his intention to buy , quite often the reverse applies , traders said .

asian cocoa producers expand despite critics asian cocoa producers are expanding output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss suggestions in the london market that their cocoa is inferior . " leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market from our product , " said a spokesman for indonesia 's directorate general of plantations . " we 're happy about our long - term future . " malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in asia and the united states if malaysian cocoa was not suitable for european tastes . they were responding to comments by london traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from malaysia , indonesia and papua new guinea ( png ) were helping to depress cocoa prices . london traders said the asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids . ng siew kee , the chairman of malaysia 's cocoa growers ' council , said malaysia should expand its sales to asia and the united states if it did not produce a type suitable for western europe . a spokesman for the png cocoa industry board said the london market was mistaken if it linked png cocoa with high - acid malaysian and indonesian beans . " when the market is declining , buyers seize on anything to talk down prices , " the spokesman said . he said that png could sell whatever cocoa it produces . png exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa year ending september 30 , of which nearly 50 pct was exported to west germany , 16 pct to the u.s. and the rest to the netherlands and britain . the indonesia spokesman , an agriculture ministry official who wished not to be identified , said indonesia had no problem with quality and would continue to expand sales . he described criticism of the quality of indonesian beans as " trade politics " and said jakarta 's traditional links with dutch buyers meant it did not have any difficulty with exports . indonesia and malaysia , asia 's two biggest commodity producers , are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the international cocoa organization ( icco ) . officials have said malaysian production is expected to total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987 . this is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986 , partly because of the end of a three - year drought in sabah , the country 's largest cocoa growing area . production of indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980 . output is projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes this year as young trees mature . both malaysia and indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than west african countries . according to one kuala lumpur trader , world prices would have to
bahia cocoa review showers continued throughout the week in the bahia cocoa zone , alleviating the drought since early january and improving prospects for the coming temporao , although normal humidity levels have not been restored , comissaria smith said in its weekly review . the dry period means the temporao will be late this year . arrivals for the week ended february 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year . again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures . comissaria smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end . with total bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers , middlemen , exporters and processors . there are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining + bahia superior+ certificates . in view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment . comissaria smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos . bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for march shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named . new crop sales were also light and all to open ports with june / july going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under new york july , aug / sept at 1,870 , 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne fob . routine sales of butter were made . march / april sold at 4,340 , 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs . april / may butter went at 2.27 times new york may , june / july at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs , aug / sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times new york sept and oct / dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times new york dec , comissaria smith said . destinations were the u.s. , covertible currency areas , uruguay and open ports . cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for march / april , 785 dlrs for may , 753 dlrs for aug and 0.39 times new york dec for oct / dec . buyers were the u.s. , argentina , uruguay and convertible currency areas . liquor sales were limited with march / april selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs , june / july at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times new york july , aug / sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times new york sept and oct / dec at 1.25 times new york dec
ghana cocoa purchases 1,323 tonnes in   latest week , cumulative 216,095 tonnes - official   ghana cocoa purchases 1,323 tonnes in   latest week , cumulative 216,095 tonnes - official  
ghana cocoa purchases fall , cumulative still up the ghana cocoa board said it purchased 1,323 tonnes of cocoa in the 21st week , ended february 26 , of the 1986/87 main crop season , compared with 1,961 tonnes the previous week and 1,344 tonnes in the 21st week ended march six of the 1985/86 season , the board said . cumulative purchases so far this season stand at 216,095 tonnes , still up on the 201,966 tonnes purchased by the 21st week of last season , the board said .  
pessimism mounts over bahian temporao cocoa crop pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago . trade sources told reuters from the state capital of salvador that despite scattered rains since mid - february , which broke a six week drought , plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the may / september crop . the sources said arrivals from may through july might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected . arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered . however , the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot , which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid , and which is more likely from late july on . this year 's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot . a severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period , one source said . because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage , estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits . although flowering was good following the start of the rains , pod setting was not up to expectations , possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers , the sources said . however , reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good , which should result in mature fruit from august through september . the sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop , which officially starts on october 1 . " the cut - off date is completely artificial . if things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from august through november or even december , " one said . if predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years . the last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags , the lowest since 1974 . good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags , just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record ,
ivory coast confirms presence at cocoa talks a senior ivory coast agriculture ministry official confirmed his country 's backing for a new international cocoa pact and said ivorian delegates would be present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week . the official told reuters that ivorian agriculture minister denis bra kanon would attend the opening of the talks , convened by the international cocoa organization ( icco ) , in london on monday . while bra kanon is due to return home this week for funeral ceremonies for a sister of ivorian president felix houphouet - boigny , scheduled to be held in the country 's capital yamoussoukro between march 19 - 22 , senior ivorian delegates will be present throughout the london talks , the official said . bra kanon is chairman of the icco council and rumours that he or ivorian delegates might be delayed because of public mourning in the west african nation helped depress already low world cocoa prices friday . the official said ivory coast continued to support the new pact , which was agreed in principle last year by most of the world 's cocoa exporters and consumers . he also said bra kanon would fulfil his duties as icco council chairman during the talks , scheduled to end on march 27 . the meeting aims to set rules for the operation of the pact 's buffer stock which producers hope will boost a market hit by successive world cocoa surpluses . ivory coast did not participate in the last international cocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked hopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices .  
colombia business asked to diversify from coffee a colombia government trade official has urged the business community to aggressively diversify its activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee . samuel alberto yohai , director of the foreign trade institute , incomex , said private businessmen should not become what he called " mental hostages " to coffee , traditionally colombia 's major export . the national planning department forecast that in 1987 coffee will account for only one - third of total exports , or about 1.5 billion dlrs , with oil and energy products making up another third and non - traditional exports the remainder .  
coffee could drop to 70/80 cts , cardenas says international coffee prices could drop to between 70 and 80 cents a lb by next october if no agreement is reached to support the market , jorge cardenas , manager of colombia 's national coffee growers ' federation said . speaking at a forum for industrialists , he said one of the reasons was that the market was already saturated and that producers will have excess production and stockpiles of 39 mln ( 60-kg ) bags in 1987 . today , may futures in new york settled at 107.90 cents a lb .  
colombia coffee registrations remain open colombia 's coffee export registrations remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered , gilberto arango , president of the private exporters ' association said . " the philosophy of the new policy is not to close registrations . nobody so far said may would be closed , " he told reuters . on march 13 , colombia opened registrations for april and may for an unlimited amount . without giving breakdowns , arango said private exporters had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to april 6 , or roughly 440,000 bags per month , slightly lower than the average in recent years . he estimated the amount of bags registered by the national coffee growers ' federation at about the same , meaning a total of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by colombia . " the only change that could happen is , because of the volume , we would be told that from such a date , registrations would be for june shipment , etc " arango said .

uganda pulls out of coffee market - trade sources uganda 's coffee marketing board ( cmb ) has stopped offering coffee on the international market because it is unhappy with current prices , coffee trade sources said . the board suspended offerings last week but because of its urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it could sustain , the sources added . hundreds of ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been waiting several months for payment from the cmb , which has had trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the kenyan port of mombasa . foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by holding up remittance of uganda 's hard currency earnings from coffee exports , the government newspaper new vision said . the banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money and president yoweri museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty for such delays , it added . banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the current coffee year , while the government had asked for 100 billion . the cmb has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee , about 15 pct of annual production , stockpiled in kampala awaiting shipment . the crop accounts for over 90 pct of uganda 's export earnings and the recent slide in prices to four - year lows is likely to more than offset an expected increase in production . cmb officials have forecast that because the government has restored law and order in important growing areas , uganda will produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending september 30 , about 25 pct more than in 1985/6 .

mild coffee growers to meet in guatemala a large group of " other milds " coffee - growing nations will hold talks in guatemala next month to map their strategy for next september 's meeting of the international coffee organisation ( ico ) . mario fernandez , executive director of the costa rican coffee institute , said delegates from mexico , the dominican republic , peru , ecuador , india , papua new guinea and five central american nations will participate in the two - day strategy session beginning may 4 . the main topic will be reform of what many producing countries perceive as the ico 's unfair distribution of export quotas , fernandez said . he said costa rica would press for quotas " based on the real production and export potential of each country in the past few years " and to distribute quotas based on " historic " production levels rather than recent harvests and crop estimates .  
mexico has no plans to leave ico mexico has no intention of leaving the international coffee organization ( ico ) , in the event of brazil withdrawing from the group , the mexican coffee institute ( imc ) said . the imc said in a statement the ico is an important instrument for ensuring producers obtain an adequate price . mexico currently produces around five mln 60-kilo bags of coffee per year . brazil said during a meeting of coffee producers in rio de janeiro over the weekend that it would consider leaving the ico if its export quota was reduced by the organization .  
rpt - european trade may propose new ico formula european coffee traders and roasters may propose a new formula for calculating international coffee organization ( ico ) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting here this week , traders and officials told reuters . although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the possible new formula , they said it would give brazil , the world 's biggest coffee producer , unchanged ico quotas for the next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation . " the main sticking point on quotas has been brazil 's attitude , and this compromise could be a solution , " one said . however , the european coffee trade federation meeting , which began here today and is to continue to the end of the week , has revealed gaps in the european position on re - introducing quotas . traders said that , as a whole , the trade side was against re - introduction of ico quotas , while roasters were generally in favour with the single proviso that there had to be some formula basis for re - allocating quota shares among producing countries . the roasters said the positions were generally fairly close , and problems with some government officials . germany and italy were cited as the extremes of polarized government attitudes , with most other countries on the fence . sources said germany was the most extreme against quota re - introduction , while the italians were most in favour . " nevertheless , we expect to find enough common ground by the end of the week to at least present a common european community ( ec ) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the international coffee agreement ( ica ) in july , " one trader said . " we hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not only the consumer side , but the producer side will accept it , " one official said . " we have learned that we can live without the quotas that were suspended in february last year , but would prefer the stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as quota allocation is concerned , " he added . overall , however , trader and roaster opinion on the likelihood of a successful re - negotiation was mildly pessimistic , varying between a 50 - 50 chance and 60 - 40 against . " our main difficulty will be to persuade the u.s. on the consumer side and brazil on the producer side to agree to quota re - introduction , " he said . " the u.s. position has , if anything , hardened , while the new brazilian coffee institute president has adopted the least negotiable position of any of his predecessors , " one trader said . " however , with
ibc details plans to pay creditors the brazilian coffee institute , ibc , gave details of its plans to pay the 18 companies that bought 630,000 bags of robusta coffee in the london market on its behalf last september . an ibc spokesman told reuters that a 15 mln dlr loan from the banco do brasil would be used to pay five mln dlrs a month in june , july and august to creditors . he said an auction of coffee would raise additional money and added that a reuter report on june 16 gave the wrong impression that the auction was necessary to raise part of the 15 mln dlrs . no date has yet been set for the auction .  
european coffee trade proposes new quota formula european coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating international coffee organization , ico , quotas , dutch coffee trade association chairman chairman frits van horick said . van horick , who is a council member of the european coffee federation , was speaking at the end of the ecf annual meeting . the new formula is based on six - year moving averages and would give brazil , the world 's biggest coffee producer , an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement , van horick said . if accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ico , the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement , van horick said . coffee quotas were suspended in february last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought - induced crop disaster in brazil . although prices are now considerably lower , consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re - introduction . " brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota . but our proposal leaves it very little to object to , " van horick said . " the existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality , " he said . " our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone . " although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out , initial estimates suggest countries such as colombia , kenya , indonesia and costa rica would get slightly higher quotas , while others such as the ivory coast , el salvador and nicaragua would lose quota share , van horick said . because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply , it should also prevent under - shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year 's quota . " if the ico consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the september meeting , most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula , " van horick said . at the same time much will depend on brazil 's attitude . " brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side . if there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal , we might just get an agreement , " van horick added .  
colombia helpful but coffee quotas uncertain -- u.s. a u.s. government trade official responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent colombian efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers . jon rosenbaum , an assistant u.s. trade representative just back from trade talks in colombia , said most producing countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas . " there is one country which evidently still does not , " rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to brazil , which has been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas . rosenbaum said because of the stance of brazil the outlook for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the september international coffee organization meeting is hard to predict . he said that during the visit to bogota he held technical discussions with colombian officials . while he did not meet with jorge cardenas , head of the colombian coffee producers federation , who was in europe , cardenas left a " positive letter , " rosenbaum said . the cardenas letter responded to a u.s. letter last month which praised colombia for trying to find a compromise formula for the reintroduction of quotas , but outlined several concerns with the technical details of the colombian plan . rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment on a new formula for calculating ico quotas agreed to by european coffee roasters and traders . dutch coffee trade association chairman frits van horick said in amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving averages and would give brazil an unchanged export quota for the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement . the u.s. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas unless " objective criteria " which reflect recent changes in the coffee market are used to set export limits .

brazil could export 19 mln bags of coffee -ibc brazil 's coffee exports could amount to 19 mln bags this year , because of the excellent crop estimate of 35.2 mln bags , an ibc spokesman said . he said exports could surpass the average annual 18 mln bags mark , especially if the final harvest to be conducted in october and november confirms the crop at over 35 mln bags . he said the average limit of errors for the official crop harvest could be set at five pct above or below the first estimates officially published today . he said the ibc agreed with a request by producers for the institute to ask the government for a monthly indexation of the guarantee minimum price .  
dauster says consumers should keep out of quotas consumer countries should not intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas , brazilian coffee institute president jorio dauster said . " distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of producers as has been traditional , " dauster , a delegate at the recent coffee symposium here , told journalists . " when consumers want to get involved , talks are much more difficult . " the main consumer country the united states and main producer brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution when the international coffee organisation ( ico ) met in february . dauster said brazil 's role when the ico meets in london in september will be to support the world coffee pact , defend its market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the hands of producer countries . " we have sacrificed a great deal already , " he said . " this year we have a crop of 35 mln bags , we have economic problems and we are not in a position to do favours . "  
u.s. coffee import reporting system questioned a voluntary compliance system for monitoring u.s. coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry , said analysts and trade sources . " many sectors of the trade , including large roasters and importers , are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past , which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other , " one analyst said . on monday , a national coffee association newsletter said the office of u.s. trade representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the congressional trade bill . under the arrangement , milar to one in 1980 , coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the u.s. government until congress approves the monitoring authority , but if coffee arrives without valid certification , it will still be allowed entry . while many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the u.s. , others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls , trade sources said . " last time , there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines , " a u.s. customs spokesman said . " customs can do a good job when given the tools , but when its hands are tied , it does n't have the authority to demand form o ( documents tracking merchandise from source to destination ) , " he said . many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system . " it is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement , " said one major u.s. roaster . " last time we had a gentleman 's agreement , the trade did not act as a gentleman , " said another analyst adding , " without the need to submit documents , the ball will be in the producers ' hands . " some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two - tier market , in which non - member countries buy coffee at a big discount . many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non - member countries at discounts and then bring it into the u.s. falsely labelled . according to customs officials , several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non - member destinations , forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans . " if there 's that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another , producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non - member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions , " said paine
ibc seeks export details to set coffee quotas the brazilian coffee institute ( ibc ) has given shippers until close of business on thursday to submit details of past export performance in order that individual quotas can be allocated , an ibc spokesman said . he told reuters ibc president jorio dauster has confirmed acceptance of national coffee policy council ( cnpc ) proposals to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export performance , 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction . shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive months between april 1 , 1985 , and september 30 , 1987 , to be used for calculating the export performace portion . the ibc will total all the figures , calculate each shippers participation and use this as a basis for allocation of individual quotas , the ibc spokesman said . he said the ibc has already settled with the sao paulo mercantile exchange how the auction system will operate . shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export sales declaration form . auctions will not start until after the opening of export registrations . the spokesman could not say when this might be but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of the week , opening registraions from monday . a meeting has been set for tomorrow in brasilia of the cnpc 's export marketing committee to establish a system for allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels , the spokesman added . a system of individual export quotas is being reestablished in brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure shipments are kept in line with the country 's ico quota .  
ico executive board to meet early november the international coffee organization ( ico ) executive board is to hold a meeting on november 3/4 , its first since export quotas were re - introduced early this month . an ico spokesman said the session , for the first time under the chairmanship of bruno caron of france , will review the market situation and the operation of quotas . on november 5 the six exporters making up the ico board of management of the promotion fund will review its program for the 1987/88 year ( oct / sept ) and items left over from 1986/87 . on november 2 a six nation working group will consider stock verification in papua new guinea .  
turkey calls for dialogue to solve dispute turkey said today its disputes with greece , including rights on the continental shelf in the aegean sea , should be solved through negotiations . a foreign ministry statement said the latest crisis between the two nato members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute and an agreement on this issue would effect the security , economy and other rights of both countries . " as the issue is basicly political , a solution can only be found by bilateral negotiations , " the statement said . greece has repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the international court of justice . the two countries approached armed confrontation last month after greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the aegean and turkey said it would also search for oil . a face - off was averted when turkey confined its research to territorrial waters . " the latest crises created an historic opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries , " the foreign ministry statement said . turkey 's ambassador in athens , nazmi akiman , was due to meet prime minister andreas papandreou today for the greek reply to a message sent last week by turkish prime minister turgut ozal . the contents of the message were not disclosed .

u.s. oil dependency seen rising to record level the united states ' dependency on foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s , according to john h. lichtblau , president of petroleum industry research associates . lichtblau , speaking at an alternative energy conference here , said the u.s. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995 , surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977 . " the long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable , " lichtblau said . as much as 30 pct of u.s. oil imports in 1995 could come from opec nations , he said . lichtblau said the u.s. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990 . " however , the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction , " lichtblau said . he said that one of the government 's negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration . lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices . " an international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the u.s. than if we imposed it alone , " lichtblau said . development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in alaska could lessen u.s. dependency on foreign oil , lichtblau said . a potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of opec nations to raise oil prices , he said . lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling , to fill the strategic petroleum reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy .

ecuador crude oil output to resume next month ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil output on may 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouring colombia should be finished , an energy ministry spokesman said . oil output was halted on march 5 by an earthquake which damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at lago agrio to the ecuadorean port of balao on the pacific . about 13 km of the new link , capable of carrying some 50,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) , has been built , he said . ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the earthquake . the new link will connect lago agrio to puerto colon in colombia , the starting point of columbia 's pipeline to the pacific ocean port of temuco . the government estimates it will take about four more months to repair the lago agrio to balao pipeline and return output to normal levels , the spokesman said .

kuwaiti daily says opec credibility at stake opec 's credibility faces fresh scrutiny in coming weeks amid signs of a significant rise in supplies of oil to international oil markets , the kuwait daily al - qabas said . in an article headlined , " gulf oil sources say middle east production up 1.4 mln bpd , " it warned opec 's official prices could face fresh pressure from international oil companies seeking cheaper supplies . it did not say whether only opec or both opec and other producers were behind the reported rise in mideast output . nor did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts . " the sources said the credibility of opec would come under fresh scrutiny from today ( monday ) , with activity in the european and american markets , " the daily said . the sources were quoted as saying that after opec had in march demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements , some members had raised output last week . it gave no details . " dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if opec was able to control production , or whether the days of cheating and producing over quotas has begun anew , " it said . the sources warned that " maybe the ( price of a ) barrel of oil will fall below 18 , perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if there is no control on supplies , " it said . " the sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure opec over contract prices , similar to the struggle last march , " it said , apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift from qatar unless it gave price discounts . " more than one official has warned opec would find its solidarity under scrutiny by the end of april or start of may , " it said , noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer .  
texaco & lt;tx > says some oil flows re - established texaco inc has re - established some key oil supply lines following yesterday 's court filing for protection under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankrupcty code , said elton yates , texaco 's coordinator of worldwide operations . " several companies say they are willing to start trading , " yates told reuters in an interview . the company last week had stated that a number of domestic and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil shipments , and in some cases , had cut supplies altogether . banks had also cut credit lines , it said in court filings . manufacturers hanover corp & lt;mhc > and other banks told texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line , texaco said in the court filing . chase manhattan corp & lt;cmb > and j.p. morgan co 's & lt;jpm > morgan guaranty trust co asked for deposits to cover transactions , it said . the severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose from an unfavorable ruling last monday by the u.s. supreme court in texaco 's ongoing dispute with pennzoil co & lt;pzl > over the acquisition of getty oil co in 1984 . the high court said texas courts must consider texaco 's plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case . " most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they could , " elton said . but following monday 's supreme court ruling , texaco 's suppliers began demanding cash and halting supplies . " it was n't until last wednesday that it turned into an avalanche , " he said . " supplies were cut to the point where we could not run the system at anywhere near capacity . " he said less than half of texaco 's oil supplies had been in jeapordy , but the cut off would have produced severe shortages by mid - may . now the situation appears much less severe , elton said . it said that sonatrach , the algerian national oil company , canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas , occidental petroleum co & lt;oxy > demanded cash for crude , and atlantic richfield co & lt;arc > asked for special safeguards . the company also said british petroleum co plc & lt;bp > last week refused to accept an order for fuel oil . but yates today said , " a big u.k. company has in fact said they would go on supplying . they had cancelled last week . " he declined to identify the company . & lt;petroleos de venezuela s.a. > , the venezuelan state oil company that supplies a large portion of texaco 's oil , also halted shipments two weeks ago , yates said . but he added that texaco expected to meet with the venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key supply

doe resolves issues with royal dutch & lt;rd > unit the energy department said it had approved in final form an agreement that resolves all remaining issues with shell oil co over oil pricing and allocation controls that ended in 1981 . under the agreement , the royal dutch / shell group unit agreed to pay 20 mln dlrs to settle refiner pricing issues and 160 mln dlrs to settle crude oil pricing issues , doe said . doe said that before making the pact final , it modified it to reflect shell 's compliance with the tertiary incentive program , a provision not in the version published last dec 31 .  
abu dhabi marketing said not breaching opec pact a senior abu dhabi oil official said in remarks published today the emirate , largest producer in the united arab emirates ( uae ) , was succeeding in marketing its crude oil without breaching opec accords . khalaf al - oteiba , marketing director at the abu dhabi national oil co ( adnoc ) , told the company 's petroleum community magazine adnoc was also keen to keep good customer relations . " the company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its customers in accordance with market conditions ... and take necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production , " he said . " the present oil marketing policy of adnoc is based on adherence to opec decisions of december 1986 to control production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to stabilize the market , " he added . opec agreed last december to limit production to 15.8 mln bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel . oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future depended on how much discipline opec showed . oteiba said last year , when world oil prices dropped , was adnoc 's most difficult ever but " a practical and flexible pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market environment . " he said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average 609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported . refined product sales totalled eight mln metric tonnes , of which 67 pct was exported . in 1985 , adnoc marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products .

texaco filing adds uncertainty in oil market u.s. oil traders said texaco inc 's filing for protection under the chapter 11 bankruptcy code is adding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market , but opinions are divided on the impact to the market . " the filing is holding up wet barrel trading today , " said one trader . " everyone is talking about it , assessing their company 's situations in relation to texaco , " he added . some traders said companies that deal with texaco are concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies under the bankruptcy filing . however , others were less worried . " the first paid will be the trading community and those connected with texaco in the shipping industry , " one new york trader said . " if texaco does n't get crude supplies it ca n't run its refineries , so its other assets would not be worth anything , " he added . texaco filed for protection under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement with pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally interferring with pennzoil 's proposed purchase of getty oil co. however , others were less worried . " the first paid will be the trading community and those connected with texaco in the shipping industry , " one new york trader said . " if texaco does n't get crude supplies it ca n't run its refineries , so its other assets would not be worth anything , " he added . texaco filed for protection under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement with pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally interferring with pennzoil 's proposed purchase of getty oil co. " there is some reluctance to trade with texaco but no great change , " said another trader , adding that traders are tending toward prudence in their dealings with the company . traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or letters of credit , or to continue to trade as usual with texaco on an open line basis , he said . another trader , however , described today 's activity as business as usual , adding that traders feel more secure because no liens can be put on texaco 's assets while it is in bankruptcy . traders said there was no apparent effect of the texaco filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange might lower texaco 's position limit and require higher margins for texaco 's trades . new york mercantile exchange president rosemary mcfadden declined to comment on texaco 's futures trading , saying that is is proprietary information . mcfadden did say , however , that as a matter of procedure , it is possible the exchange can lower allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for companies that are in financial trouble
ecuador says will resume limited oil production ecuador will resume limited crude output next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil to a colombian pipeline on may one , the state ecuadorean petroleum corp ( cepe ) said . cepe manager carlos romoleroux told reporters that ecuador would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link - up to neighbouring colombia . oil production in ecuador was halted on march five when an earthquake damaged the country 's main pipeline from lago agrio , at the heart of the ecuadorean jungle oilfields , to the pacific port of balao . it will take at least until the end of july to repair the pipeline and return output to normal levels . the country was pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor . to resume limited output in the meantime , ecuador is constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup , capable of carrying 55,000 bpd , from lago agrio to puerto colon , the starting point of colombia 's pipeline to the pacific port of tumaco . the original target date to resume limited crude output was may eight , the scheduled date for the inauguration of the lago agrio to puerto colon pipeline , an energy ministry spokesman said .  
saudi arabia wants to increase oil sales to japan saudi arabia hopes to increase the volume of its oil exports to japan through expanding bilateral trade , saudi arabian interior minister naif bin abdul - aziz said . he told a tokyo reception his country hopes to raise crude and products exports to japan to earlier levels , but did not elaborate . to promote trade , saudi arabia is inviting japanese industries to do business there , he said . japanese firms now have long - term contracts to import a total of 150,000 barrels per day of saudi crude .  
ecuador to use colombia oil link for five years ecuador will use a new pipeline link with colombia to export crude oil for the next five years , colombian mines and energy minister guillermo perry said . the link will be inaugurated on may 8 . it was built to allow ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on march 5 by earthquake damage to its lago agrio to balao pipeline , once that pipeline is repaired , ecuador will exceed its opec quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts contracted with venezuela and nigeria since the quake , ecuador mines and energy minister javier espinosa said . the two ministers were speaking at a news conference after signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation of the jungle border zone between the two nations . drilling will begin in september . " the agreement to transport ecuadorean crude oil is not only for this emergency period but for the next five years , with possibility of an extension . between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) will be pumped along it , " perry said . espinosa said ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels through the link in the next five years , at a cost of 75 cents per barrel during the first year . the 43-km link , with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd , will run from lago agrio , the centre of of ecuador 's jungle oilfields , to an existing colombian pipeline that runs to the pacific port of tumaco . espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs . perry gave no figures for colombia 's 11 km segment but said it was " insignificant compared with what we are going to earn . " opec member ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before the quake . lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln dlrs per month , espinosa said .  
pemex official says opec output critical to price crude oil prices could remain around 18 dlrs a barrel until the end of the year , but opec 's decision on output at its next meeting would be the critical factor , an official of mexico 's state oil company , petroleos mexicanos ( pemex ) , told a group of japanese businessmen . adrian lajous , pemex ' executive vice president of international trade , said current opec output already appeared to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself for the third quarter . " production is surging ahead of what was originally planned , while demand is growing more slowly than envisaged a few months ago , " he said . he said opec had to look very carefully at what level of production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the 18 dlrs price , and that an increase to what had originally been envisaged might soften price levels . the 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on june 25 in vienna to review its december accord on prices and output . " i hope opec will follow a very conservative attitude in terms of volume decisions , " lajous said . a repetition of what happened last year , when opec boosted output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs , is always there as a possibility , he said . " i hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986 . i expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and discipline will be maintained , " he said . lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil markets , but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during 1987 if output remains under control . he said saudi king fahd 's remarks last month , that increased production was not so important as long as incomes would not be affected by the output , were " very relevant and welcome from such a powerful producer . "  
saudi renegotiation of aramco deal moving along saudi arabia 's renegotiation of its collective agreement with aramco to purchase oil for the latter 's ex - partners is moving along and should lead to a fundamental structural change in the contract , oil industry sources said . petroleum intelligence weekly , in this monday 's edition , said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34 mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and volumes and other terms may be rearranged . the agreement signed in january for the months from february to june is up for renegotiation . under the january contract aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln bpd for the four partners allocated among them as exxon corp & lt;xon > 440,000 bpd , texaco inc & lt;tx > 350,000 bpd , mobil corp & lt;mob > and chevron corp & lt;chv > 550,000 bpd between them . but an overlifting by texaco inc in the first quarter allowed other companies like exxon corp to underlift its obligations under the contract piw said that that one alternative under consideration is to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective agrement . john lichtblau , director of the petroleum industry research foundation inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of a formality as the saudis have each company on a separate schedule although separate agreements with the companies would favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted liftings occur . " the companies will probably follow the saudi wants within limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long haul , " he said . lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely concentrate on volume rather than price . saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted and in april industry publications said that renegotiation were being sought , a fact later confirmed by reuters with aramco . aramco corp was formerly owned by chevron corp & lt;chv > , exxon corp & lt;xon > , mobil corp & lt;mob > and texaco inc & lt;tx > but is now owned by saudi arabia which bought its assets although the ex - partners have various agreements with saudi arabia .

china wants to buy 5,000 tonnes pakistani cotton china is negotiating with pakistan to buy 5,000 tonnes of cotton this year , after importing the same amount last year under a barter agreement , chinese consulate sources said . chinese ambassador tian ding told a meeting of pakistani industrialists on thursday that china intended to increase imports from pakistan to reduce a trade imbalance . pakistani officials estimate the country 's cotton output from the current crop at a record 7.6 mln bales ( 375 pounds each ) . last year 's output totalled 7.2 mln bales and domestic consumption was just below three mln bales , they said .  
west texas cotton crop unscathed by storm the west texas cotton crop was largely unscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last night that packed hurricane - force winds , crop and weather experts said . " there might have been some isolated storms , but certainly nothing damaging , " said charles stichler , an extension agronomist with the agricultural extension service in far west texas . rumors of a damaging storm in west texas helped the new york cotton futures market rally sharply this morning . cotton for december delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95 cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25 cents . " what happened is that the storm hit lubbock airport , and when that happens , everybody sees it , " said dale mohler , a senior meteorologist with accu - weather inc. lubbock is the heart of the west texas cotton region , which produces about 80 pct of that state 's crop . the storm produced winds of about 75 mph . " that 's hurricane force . but they were isolated to just a small portion of the west texas area , probably less than five pct , " mohler said . " no doubt there was some damage . but if it had hit in july or august ( when fruiting would be underway ) it would have been worse , " mohler said . about 60 pct of the west texas cotton crop has been planted , and the remainder could be done by the weekend if weather remains hot and dry , stichler said . the temperature in west texas since mid - week has been about 95 degrees . but a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier than normal rainfall for several weeks , he said .  
tanzanian cotton threatened by lack of storage about 60,000 tonnes of harvested raw cotton may be spoiled by rain in tanzania 's northern shinyanga region because it is stored in the open or in crude village sheds , radio tanzania reported . the cotton , worth one billion shillings , can not be moved to ginneries in the region because most mill warehouses are full . many mills are not working because of a lack of spare parts , it added . agriculture ministry officials have forecast a 1987/88 cotton harvest of about 200,000 tonnes , down from 215,000 in 1986/87 .

pakistan cotton output reaches 7.7 mln bales pakistan cotton production during the current crop season ( sept / march ) reached 7.7 mln bales of 375 pounds each , up 500,000 from last season , shafi niaz , chairman of the agricultural prices commission , said . official sources said pakistan was likely to use 3.4 mln bales of cotton during the current financial year ending june after 2.96 mln in 1985/86 and 2.70 mln in 1984/85 . they said consumption would increase due to a rise in demand for cotton yarn in domestic markets and abroad . pakistan produced 540 mln kilos of yarn in fiscal year 1985/86 and exported 157 mln . the state - owned cotton export corporation was likely to export 3.8 mln bales of cotton during the current fiscal year compared with 3.86 mln last year , cotton traders said . the traders said there would be 1.3 mln bales of cotton carryover this fiscal year compared with just over a mln bales last year .  
s.korea to buy more cotton , especially u.s. cotton south korea plans to import about 387,000 tonnes of cotton this year compared to 225,000 tonnes in 1986 , trade ministry officials said . more than three quarters of the total , some 290,000 tonnes , will come from the united states . that will be a 93.7 pct increase on 1986 when u.s. imports totalled 150,000 tonnes , an official said . he said the u.s. increase is due partly to the competitiveness of american cotton and partly to efforts by seoul to reduce its trade surplus with washington . south korea is the second largest importer of u.s. cotton after japan .  
india 1986/87 cotton export quota up 190,000 bales india 's raw cotton export quota has been raised by 190,000 170-kg bales to 600,000 bales in 1986/87 ending august , still well below the 1985/86 quota of 1.35 mln bales , minister of state for textiles r.n. mirdha said . state and private agencies contracted to export 1.34 mln bales in 1985/86 , he told journalists . but only 433,000 bales were shipped that year , with the rest to be delivered in 1986/87 . about 758,000 bales from 1985/86 contracts were shipped up to february 2 in 1986/87 . the government will export 600,000 bales of long and extra- long staple cotton in the three years from 1986/87 , he said .

china trying to increase cotton output , paper says china 's 1987 cotton output must rise above the 1986 level of 3.54 mln tonnes or supply will fall short of increasing demand , the china daily said . demand in 1986 rose 10.9 pct over 1985 . output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and a record 6.2 mln in 1984 , official figures show . the china daily attributed the decline to several factors , including less favorable weather conditions and new state measures to restrict cotton production after the 1984 build - up of stocks . according to customs figures , cotton exports rose to 558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985 . to increase output quickly , the state will raise by 10 pct the price it pays for cotton produced above and beyond quota levels , the newspaper said . its official purchasing agencies will buy cotton produced in excess of that originally contracted for , it added . the china daily said all cotton growing areas in south china should be maintained , and growing in the north should be concentrated in hebei , shandong , henan and xinjiang . it called for comprehensive planning to coordinate production of cotton with that of grain , edible oil and other crops , but gave no more details .  
u.s. cotton certificate expiration date extended expiration dates on upland cotton certificates issued under the 1986 upland cotton program are being extended , the agriculture department announced . the certificates are being extended because of a shortage of commodity credit corporation inventory available for exchange with certificates , usda undersecretary danial amstutz said . presently , upland cotton commodity certificates expire nine months from the last day of the month of issuance . under the new procedure , all current outstanding and all new upland cotton certificates issued under the 1986 upland cotton program will have an expiration date of either february 29 , 1988 , or nine months from the last day of the month in which the certificate is issued , whichever is later .  
israel 's five - year plan to boost agriculture israel has drawn up a five - year plan for 1987 - 1991 to raise agricultural production by 500 mln dlrs to 2.7 billion dlrs , an annual rise of 3.4 pct , the israeli ministry of agriculture said . agricultural exports are to be increased by 180 mln dlrs , or 4.8 pct per year on average . the area planted to cotton is to remain at the 1986 level of 100,000 to 112,500 acres with exports expected to bring in 80 to 90 mln dlrs per year . the 34 pct decline from the 1985 level reflects continued water rationing which will remain in force , the ministry said . groundnut production is planned to increase by 13,000 tonnes , or 57 pct , by 1991 and exports by 9,000 tonnes , or 82 pct . maize production is targetted to rise by 48,000 tonnes , or 48 pct , and exports by 34,000 tonnes , or 45 pct .  
final 1986 crop u.s. cotton ginnings final 1986 crop u.s. cotton ginnings totaled 9,438,425 running bales , vs 12,987,834 bales at the end of the 1985 season and 12,544,866 bales at end-1984 season , the u.s. census bureau said . the bureau said upland cotton ginnings from the final 1986 crop totaled 9,237,296 bales , vs 12,837,088 bales in 1985 and 12,418,749 bales in 1984 . american pima ginnings from the final 1986 crop totaled 201,129 bales , vs 150,746 bales in the 1985 crop and 126,117 bales in 1984 , the bureau said .  
analysts peg u.s. cotton seedings 10.6 mln acres u.s. cotton farmers are likely to plant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season , based on an average of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearing up for the u.s. agriculture department 's 1987 planting intentions report next tuesday . the annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpse of what u.s. production might be in the 1987/88 season , which begins august 1 . trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to 10.9 mln acres . on march 18 of last year , the usda reported that cotton farmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres . four months later , the usda estimated that 9.67 mln acres had been planted as of june 1 . by january , its estimate of 1986 planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln . analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in 1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year 's good demand and firm prices will be repeated next year . analysts said those factors make cotton a profitable crop . " with cotton more attractive price - wise , i think there is going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton . soybeans are dirt cheap , " said lisbeth keefe of cargill investor services , whose comments were echoed by other cotton market specialists . changes in the u.s. cotton program also could lead to increased acreage , analysts said . they recalled that under the 1986 program , cotton farmers who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in government warehouses . but under the 1987 plan , the government will not pick up the tab for storage . analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from participating in the program , which could result in more cotton . " the cotton program stipulates a mandatory set - aside of 25 pct of a farmer 's base acreage , " noted judy weissman of shearson lehman brothers . but farmers who elect not to participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage they have . some analysts said cotton farmers in the high - yielding western states would be most likely to steer clear of the program . " western acreage should be up at least 20 pct , " said one commission house analyst , whose estimate was based in part on forecasts made by the national cotton council during its annual meeting in late january . but others disagreed . " i think some western growers have decided they should be in the program for security reasons . there 's a lot of comfort in knowing you 'll be guaranteed the government 's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb . anyone outside the program is subject to the wiles of the market , " said walter brown , market analyst for
little risk seen for texas cotton from cold texas ' cotton crop stands little chance of damage from frigid temperatures expected tonight in that state , as very little cotton has been planted , according to texas agricultural sources and cotton market analysts . " it 's still pretty early for cotton planting . only six pct of the crop was planted as of last week , " said doug stillmann , a statistician at the texas agricultural statistic service in austin , a division of the u.s. agriculture department . stillmann and other cotton market sources said planting had begun in the rio grande valley and south texas areas only , with planting in the crucial high and low plains areas not slated to begin until next month . the high and low plains accounted for 60 pct of the 2.5 mln bales produced in texas last year , stillmann said . temperatures tonight in most of texas are expected to drop to freezing to the low 20s , although the lower rio grande valley may see more moderate readings in the middle 30s , according to meteorologists at accu - weather inc. the price of new - crop cotton on the new york cotton futures market rallied today on weather - related fears .

" i think all partners are hopeful that the situation will be resolved , " cominco 's townson said . " we 're optimistic that they will be concluded shortly , " he added . townson declined to specify when the talks might end . cominco and teck 's 22 pct - owned lornex agreed in january 1986 to form the joint venture , merging their highland valley copper operations . cominco and lornex share equally in control and management of the highland valley operations , while cominco has a 55 pct share of production and lornex receives 45 pct . for the six months following july 1 , 1986 , when the venture officially started production , highland valley had total ore milled of 22.6 mln short tons , grading an average of 0.41 pct copper , townson said . cominco 's share of production was 43,000 short tons of copper contained in concentrate , 1,200 short tons of molybdenum in concentrate , 340,000 ounces of silver and 800 ounces of gold , he said . a consortium , 50 pct owned by teck and 25 pct each by mim ( canada ) inc and metallgesellschaft canada ltd , acquired its cominco stake last year from canadian pacific ltd & lt;cp>.

phelps dodge & lt;pd > sees stronger copper prices phelps dodge corp officials said good fundamentals in copper markets should lead to improving prices for the metal . in an interview with reuters , chairman g. robert durham said continued strong demand and low inventories pushed prices up eight to nine pct on the new york commodities exchange last month . " our customers in this country are living off the tailgates of our trucks , " he said , referring to tightness of supply and strong demand . " the fundamentals are good . "   asked if metal prices will continue to rise , durham said ; " all i know is , fundamentals can not be ignored . " he said copper supplies are lower than they have been for almost 20 years . last year , copper demand was second highest on record behind 1984 , he said . phelps dodge is the nation 's largest copper company , with annual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year .   during the interview , executive vice president douglas yearley said he believed it was only a matter of time before the copper price rose " because there are n't that many new projects coming on , and demand , short of a major recession , will continue to grow modestly . " copper for july delivery rose more than two cts a pound to more than 69 cents in comex trading today . a one cent a pound rise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings for phelps dodge , the company said . " demand has been surprisingly good in 1987 , in construction and other areas , " yearley said .   new production later this year from a bingham , utah , mine owned by kennecott corp , a unit of british petroleum co plc 's & lt;bp > standard oil co , a mine in new guinea and phelps dodge 's own expanded morenci , ariz. , mine will be offset by production shortfalls in mexico and zambia , he said . durham said production costs at the new mexico - located chino mine will be in line with conventional copper production at the company 's other mines by the fourth quarter . the company 's total production costs , including depreciation but before interest and corporate expense , should be below 50 cts a pound by late 1989 or 1990 , he said .

zambian copper industry hopes for steady output zambia 's copper mining industry is hoping to achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a year in the next few years despite low world prices , deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs , industry officials said . but zambia 's decision to abandon last may 1 a tough international monetary fund ( imf ) economic recovery program has introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure the ailing industry and boost profitability , they said . copper production by the government - controlled zambia consolidated copper mines ( zccm ) for the 1987 financial year ended march 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes . " we are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial year , copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due to greater availability of spares and equipment , " a zccm official said . zccm officials said the production of cobalt , another strategic income earner , will also be tailored to meet demand . finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes , 911 tonnes higher than the previous year and the best production achieved to date . protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper industry in zambia , the world 's fifth biggest producer . mining is monopolised by zccm and accounts for about 90 pct of the country 's foreign exchange earnings . production has also been seriously affected in recent years by equipment breakdowns , deteriorating ore and shortages of spare parts , fuel and lubricants . the 463,354 tonnes output last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes . a five - year production and investment plan launched in 1984 by zccm is being funded by the european community , the african development bank and the world bank . the plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable . zccm , the second largest employer after the government , has said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as part of the plan . more than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under the five - year restructuring plan . company officials said although reserves were being depleted , zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the end of the century , though at lower levels of production . industry sources said zccm 's projected pre - tax profit for the financial year ended march 31 would be around 500 mln kwacha . but with the current mineral export tax level being levied , a net loss is likely to be registered . zccm recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before . under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in 1985 , zccm

south korea to change policies to avert trade war south korea has decided on major changes in its trade , investment and finance policies aimed at reducing the growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a trade war with the united states , deputy prime minister kim mahn - je said . kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports could make south korea too reliant on exports , increase nflation and produce trade friction . the policy shift , which means abandoning seoul 's goal of rapidly reducing its foreign debt , was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings . kim , who is also economic planning minister , said the current account surplus , previously expected to exceed eight billion dlrs this year , would be held at about five billion dlrs by increasing imports , accelerating market liberalisation and rationalising exports . he said seoul would try to limit its current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few years , although trade volume would continue to grow . " this will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to gnp ( gross national product ) from the current five pct level to three pct by 1991 , " he added . koo bon - yong , an aide to kim , said south korea 's foreign debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end of 1987 , against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion , and 44.5 billion dlrs at end-1986 . " but now ( with the policy changes ) the debt is expected to remain above 40 billion dlrs , although it could still be lower than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs , " he said . the policy change was announced two days before the scheduled arrival of u.s. commerce secretary malcolm baldrige for talks with trade minister rha woong - bae . south korea is under u.s. pressure to reduce its bilateral trade surplus , which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985 . kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing in south korea 's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period . first quarter 1987 exports rose 36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs . the government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5 billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods , raw materials and equipment , preferably from the u.s. , he said .

canada current account deficit up in quarter canada 's current account deficit widened to a seasonally adjusted 2.27 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter from a deficit of 1.94 billion dlrs in the third , statistics canada said . the shortfall for the full year rose to 8.81 billion dlrs from 1985 's 584 mln dlr deficit , the federal agency said . the agency said the rise in the merchandise surplus , to 2.77 billion dlrs from 2.20 billion dlrs in the third quarter , was more than offset by high deficits in servicies and investment . the total non - merchandise deficit grew to 5.04 billion dlrs from 4.14 billion dlrs . the current account deficit was 912 mln dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1985 . in the capital account , not seasonally adjusted , there was a total net inflow of 4.76 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter , up from a net inflow of 3.22 billion dlrs in the third quarter quarter . the total net capital inflow rose to 13.74 billion dlrs in 1986 from 7.68 billion dlr in 1985 .  
dutch current account surplus falls in 1986 the dutch current account surplus fell 5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billion guilders , the finance ministry said in a statement . the surplus is expected to fall further in 1987 , the statement said , but gave no details . earlier today , the official planning agency cpb said it expected the surplus to fall to six billion guilders during 1987 . the visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6 billion guilders in 1986 to 11.4 billion due to declining terms of exchange , while more goods were imported as consumer spending and investment increased . while the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion guilders , 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporary improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay between the fall in oil and gas prices . the current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit on invisibles , compared with a balance in 1985 , the finance ministry said , noting the surplus on transport services was reduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price falls . the fourth quarter current account showed a deficit , for the first time since 1980 , of 700 mln guilders , it said .  
economic spotlight - china 's foreign debt up china 's foreign debt reached 27 billion dlrs by the end of 1986 , but despite an over - exposure to short - term credits and yen borrowing , china remains very creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook , foreign bankers and chinese officials told reuters . foreign bankers said china 's total debt rose sharply from an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased import commitments but the debt / equity ratio remains low , between eight and 10 pct . china remains a cautious and popular borrower , they said . zhang haoruo , vice minister of foreign economic relations and trade , said last friday that china signed foreign loan agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year , 96.6 pct up on 1985 , with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion , up 93 pct . officials said china would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in the 1986 - 90 five year plan period , but foreign bankers said they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion . a western banker said china 's portfolio contains too much short - term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a result of aggressive lending by japanese banks and attractive low interest rates in the japanese market . the strong yen appreciation has cost china dearly and is likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings , the banker said . a chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the country 's total debt at about 30 pct . the peking representative of a japanese securities house said the rapid yen rise had caught china and his firm unawares . " interest rates in japan are at a historical low , but china , which will remain an active borrower this year , is likely to go elsewhere for capital , to get a better currency spread , " he said . the western banker said the excess of short - term loans is in part a result of china 's inexperience in the foreign capital markets , which it entered only in the early 1980s . " officials do not think of china but of their own department or firm . some loans that were entered into did not have the full backing of the people 's republic of china , " he said . " the dilemma for china , in foreign borrowing as in other areas , is to balance central control with giving reasonable autonomy to firms . it is searching for the mechanisms to exercise indirect controls , " he said . the banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the past six weeks that china 's foreign borrowing will not be affected by a drive against " bourgeois liberalism , " a phrase meaning western political ideas , following the dismissal of communist party chief hu yaobang on january 16 . a u.s. banker said
portuguese trade deficit narrows in 1986 portugal 's trade deficit narrowed in 1986 to 336.5 billion escudos from 354.8 billion in 1985 , according to provisional national statistics institute figures . imports totalled 1,412.6 billion escudos and exports 1,076.1 billion compared with 1,326.5 billion and 971.7 billion in 1985 . expressed in terms of dollars , imports rose 21.2 pct and exports 26.1 pct and the trade deficit increased by 7.8 pct . in its first year as a member of the european community , portugal recorded a deficit of 98.1 billion escudos in its trade with the other community states compared with a deficit of 2.4 billion escudos in 1985 . imports from the ec in 1986 totalled 830.2 billion escudos , while exports to the community were 732.1 billion , compared with 609.5 billion and 607.1 billion the previous year . portugal 's deficit with spain was 83.2 billion escudos against 57.7 billion in 1985 , with italy it was 70.4 billion against 30.3 billion , and with west germany 40.5 billion against 19.1 billion .  
foreign investment in australia jumps in last qtr the net inflow of foreign investment into australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billion a year earlier , the statistics bureau said . the bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08 billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billion turnaround in direct investment . the turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billion inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter , against a 520 mln inflow a year earlier , was largely on account of government foreign currency borrowings , it said . direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billion dlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal in the third quarter , against a 546 mln inflow in the fourth quarter of 1985 , the bureau said . it said the major part of the turnaround reflected an injection of funds , estimated at around 700 mln dlrs , associated with the previously reported restructuring of the australian operations of general motors corp & lt;gm>. gm used the funds to pay out or take over certain australian liabilities of its local unit & lt;general motors - holden 's ltd > , it said . however , net borrowings remained the major part of total inflow , accounting for 6.16 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter against 3.88 billion in the third quarter and 4.03 billion a year earlier , the bureau said . net official borrowings comprised 1.52 billion dlrs against a net outflow of 548 mln in the third quarter and a 516 mln inflow a year earlier . total private and semi - public authority net borrowings rose to 4.64 billion dlrs from 4.42 billion in the third quarter and 3.51 billion a year earlier .

danish credit downgrading not dramatic - minister finance minister palle simonsen said today 's downgrading of denmark 's credit rating by standard and poor 's corp should not be over - dramatised . standard and poor 's said it had downgraded the kingdom of denmark 's long - term external debt to aa from aa - plus , following the country 's loss of the top aaa rating in january 1983 . " this change is regrettable but there is no reason to dramatise . this is a change of nuance . standard and poor 's defines the aa category as only slightly different from the top aaa rating , " simonsen said in a statement . " the direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing capability is unlikely to be very great . but if , against expectation , we fail to reduce permanently the external account deficit ... this will inevitably affect borrowing terms and capability , " he added . " standard & amp ; poor 's has noted that in 1986 there was a series of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and encourage saving . tax reforms have also gone into effect . " if and when it becomes necessary , the government will be ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives as it has in the past , " simonsen said . standard and poor 's said weaker international competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a deteriorating current account balance and a rise in external debt . the external current account deficit rose to a record preliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in 1985 , bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns , according to government statistics . government economists forecast that the external current account deficit will fall to 19 billion crowns this year . denmark 's net foreign debt rose to 129 pct of total exports in 1986 from 83 pct in 1983 , s and p said .  
global economic slowdown raises new debt fears the global economy is expected to weaken this year , adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook , economic analysts said . for finance ministers and central bankers attending this week 's semi - annual meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank , the new figures released by the imf add an additional concern . the fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct this year , versus 2.9 pct last year , and 3.1 pct in 1985 . in the industrial countries , gross national product , a measure of all goods and services , was expected to decline to 2.3 pct this year , compared with 2.4 pct in 1986 , the imf said . for the developing countries , the gross domestic product , another measure of economic growth , was expected to fall to 3.0 pct from 3.5 pct last year . the new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries . they had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt . imf officials , discussing their outlook , said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade . economic analysts and the imf have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth . since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance , economic weakness in the developed nations ' economies poses fundamental worries . debtor countries , including the very poorest states , have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange , including the key one of exports . the u.s. economy , which is in its fifth year of expansion , has served as a mainstay for developing country exports , but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year , growing by only 2.3 pct , according to the imf . for this reason and because of a high trade deficit , the united states has been pressuring japan and west germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success . the imf study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the u.s. trade deficit . reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up , although it has been much slower than expected . the imf observed in its world economic outlook that " it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect . " the
west german institutes call for early tax cuts the five leading west german economic research institutes said the government should do more to stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of tax cuts planned for 1990 . in their joint spring report the institutes were divided about 1987 growth forecasts , with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth . gross national product grew 2.4 pct last year . but the report said all the institutes believed that " more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created . " the institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible . " from this point of view , the tax reform planned for 1990 should be brought forward . " the government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion marks as part of the major tax reform . the net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks . however , the institutes criticised the government , not only for the timing of the reform , but also because the question of its financing had been left open . the government has not specified how the remaining 19 billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for , though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies . the institutes said this lack of clarity from bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a quick decision from the government . they also said the government should reduce tax preferences , which would simplify the fiscal system , urged a restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value - added tax . the institutes also criticised bonn for increasing subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged . they referred specifically to a doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this as an increase in subsidies . the institutes said total subsidies , including tax preferences , had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen further since then . given the scope of these subsidies , it should be possible " despite ... major political difficulties " to finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts . the institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost . the report also noted that the government was progressing only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and said more deregulation was needed . the government had to aim for more competition , it said .  
bangemann rejects call for early tax cuts west german economics minister martin bangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country 's leading economic research institutes for early introduction of a major tax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks . in a statement reacting to the five institutes ' joint spring report , bangemann said that as far as the call for bringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned -- " the government points out that the positive effects for growth of its policy of consolidation ( cutting the budget deficit ) must not be allowed to be endangered . " bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned for 1988 had already been increased . three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987 , with exports falling by 0.5 pct . the other two saw only one pct growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct . bangemann said " the government , agreeing with the majority , sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for exports expressed by the minority . " he said there was reason to believe that export demand would start to rise in the course of the year , partly because of a further increase in world trade .  
italian gdp rose 2.4 pct in 1986 fourth quarter italy 's gross domestic product , calculated at 1980 prices , rose 2.4 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 , compared with the same period in 1985 , national statistics institute istat said . istat said in a statement that gdp growth in fourth quarter 1986 was zero compared with the preceding quarter . italy 's budget ministry said last month that 1986 gdp rose 2.7 pct in real terms from 1985 . imports in the fourth quarter totalled 26,361 billion lire , down 1.4 pct from the 1985 fourth quarter and down 6.6 pct from the third 1986 quarter , istat said . istat said exports totaled 23,190 billion lire in the fourth quarter , down 4.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter and down 6.7 pct from the third quarter in 1986 . fixed investments were 23,438 billion lire in the fourth quarter , down 0.7 pct from the preceding quarter and up 1.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter .  
institutes see no west german recession the five leading west german economic research institutes , which have revised down their forecasts for 1987 growth , do not predict a recession in west germany , their spokesman , hans - juergen schmahl said . the institutes were divided in their spring report on forecasts for 1987 , with three predicting two pct growth and two seeing only one pct expansion . growth was 2.4 pct in 1986 . schmahl , presenting the report at a news conference , said , " none of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the beginning of a recession . " he added , however , that exports remained the weak point of the economy . schmahl also said west germany would have to expect further encroachments of foreign goods onto its markets . arthur krumper of munich 's ifo institute , which with the diw of west berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of the economy , said , " the braking effects ( on the economy ) produced by external factors will remain considerable for most of the year . "  
central bank head says philippine growth on target the philippines ' first quarter growth figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely to achieve its 1987 targets , central bank governor jose fernandez said in an interview . the national economic development authority ( neda ) announced yesterday gross domestic product ( gdp ) grew 5.78 pct and gross national product ( gnp ) 5.53 pct in the first quarter from a year earlier . " i do n't see anything on the horizon that should cut it ( growth ) short , " fernandez said . neda said gnp had grown 3.56 pct and gdp 3.25 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier . last year 's gnp growth , put earlier at 0.13 pct , was revised to 1.51 pct . " certainly i do not see any shortage in external resources and if gnp growth continues at this level i would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block , " fernandez said . " i think even before the figures came out , simply looking at key indicators , such as consumption of fuel oil and power , showed that the economy was on a different track from last year , " he said . fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather , and it could drop off in the third quarter . he said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector , which grew by 9.64 pct , after declines in 1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986 . " that is not a seasonal thing , it is secular , " he said . he said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the international monetary fund ( imf ) . it expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its 198 mln sdr stand - by arrangement soon . the philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling 58 mln sdrs from the arrangement expiring on april 23 , 1988 . fernandez said an imf mission would visit here in july or august to review performance in the january - june period . he said imf repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion dlrs over the 1987 - 92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs . repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the imf rising in the next few years . " it means that since there will be a net drain on oda ( official development assistance ) accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line , " he said . it is an internal constraint that exists because the imf debt can not be rescheduled , fernandez said . the philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28 billion
german gnp figures publication delayed figures for first quarter 1987 west german gnp will be published on june 11 after they were provisionally scheduled for june 4 , an official at the federal statistics office said . the official said there had been a delay in gathering information for the data , which are expected to show that the west german economy contracted in the period . a spokesman for the economics ministry in bonn said there was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on june 11 , the day after the venice economic summit ends . " there is no political motivation . it is a purely technical matter , " he added . the west german government is expected to come under pressure in venice from both the u.s. and its european partners to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth . however , government officials have ruled out any further tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of stimulatory fiscal measures already underway . helmut schlesinger , vice - president of the west german central bank , the bundesbank , said in tokyo today that gnp , the widest measure of a country 's economic activity , fell in real terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period . the government has confirmed that growth was negative in the first 1987 quarter . but year - on - year growth is expected to be about two pct . schlesinger today repeated the bundesbank 's reluctance to cut its official interest rates further . its key discount rate , at three pct , is just above historical lows . west german officials are likely to emphasise at the venice summit that domestic demand , which draws in goods from abroad , is already outstripping export performance , which has suffered from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over two years . the government has pointed out that depressed exports are the main reason for the current weakness in the economy , but says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will compensate for this setback . it expects gnp growth for the whole of 1987 of just under two pct , after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986 .  
pakistan says good economic growth continues pakistan says its economy has continued its recent outstanding performance during the financial year 1986/87 ending on june 30 but areas like balance of payments , investments and energy were causing concern . gdp grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980 and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70 , according to a government economic survey . the reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum and there was an impressive performance in a five point government program for rural uplift , education and poverty alleviation , said the survey . ministry economic adviser qazi alimullah told a news conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms damaged the wheat crop , gdp growth was calculated at 7.04 pct compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.he said the figure might now slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct . the survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year - end . alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from 2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86 . but the at the same time , home remittances by pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion . more exports and an improvement in the balance of payments situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in home remittances , he said . the survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to 2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of the boost in exports . he said national investment continued to be small because of a poor rate of savings , about 14 pct of gdp . he said more savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the present growth rate and to finance the country 's seventh five - year development plan to be launched in july 1988 .  
german experts say no further economic stimulus the west german government 's independent council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of the economy is inappropriate , government spokesman friedhelm ost said . a statement released by ost after a meeting of chancellor helmut kohl and senior government officials with the council said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1 - 1/2 to two pct was achievable . it added the council believed " an intensification of the already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial policy is not called for . " ost 's statement said experts believed further pressure on west germany to adapt to external economic factors would not increase . the government regularly uses the term " changed external economic factors " when referring to the fall of the dollar , which has severely damaged west german exports . bonn officials have said they expect exports to pick up during the year , but could still fall below the 1986 level . along with other leading industrial countries , west germany agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in paris in february aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar . the stance taken by the experts backs up the official position of the west german government ahead of next week 's seven nation summit in venice , where bonn is expected to be pressed by the u.s. and other partners to boost its economy . west german government officials have stressed bonn is not in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget . the bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low . the experts ' prediction for economic growth this year of between 1 - 1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a forecast made last november when two pct growth was forecast . many independent forecasters have revised down 1987 predictions in light of the downturn in exports . the government itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct , compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986 .  
s.korea sees gnp growth more than 10 pct this year south korea 's gross national product ( gnp ) will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will rise further as long as the current account surplus continues to widen , deputy prime minister chun in - yong told reporters . chung , who is also minister of economic planning , said his gnp estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will remain stable . the official target for 1987 gnp growth is eight pct . gnp rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and 1986 , according to provisional bank of korea figures . gnp rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986 . in the first four months of this year , the current account swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period . " what the minister said does not imply any major economic policy change , " a ministry spokesman told reuters . " but he tried to urge business circles to prepare for the forseeable economic ( future ) ... a high won era . " south korean manufacturers , who have insisted the won should not rise more than seven pct this year , have said they plan to ask the government to slow down its appreciation against the dollar . the bank of korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05 against the dollar , a 6.02 pct gain so far this year compared with a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986 . the won strengthened by 6.60 won to the dollar in three days earlier this month while an international monetary fund team held talks here to discuss revaluation .  
southern europe has strong domestic demand growth strong growth in domestic demand was a key feature of the economies of southern european countries in 1986 , though the growth is seen slowing this year and next , the organisation for economic cooperation and development said . in its semi - annual report , the oecd said portugal 's total domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth restrained private consumption . turkey 's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and domestic demand surged 10.5 pct , but this growth was expected to be halved to five pct next year . in spain , buoyant domestic demand , led by fixed investment , had been the driving force behind rapid growth in gross domestic product . both fixed investment and private consumption were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain strong . the oecd forecast that spanish imports would rise sharply next year , reflecting strong demand , entry to the european community and declining competitiveness . in greece , inflation was forecast to turn downwards following an increase early this year linked with the introduction of value added tax and a surge in food prices due to cold weather .  
oecd says high wage deals harming nordic states high wage settlements in nordic countries threaten to cut exports and reduce the international competitiveness of their industries , the organisation for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) said . in denmark , the oecd said wage settlements concluded in early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration in competitiveness . sweden 's competitive position was also seen at risk from accelerating wages . the oecd predicted that domestic demand would come under pressure from tight fiscal policy in denmark , as well as norway , sweden and finland . overall economic growth will vary in the different countries between 1986 and 1988 , the oecd semi - annual report said . after a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986 , total domestic demand in norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one pct the following year . denmark was also expected to see a slump in domestic demand . the report said growth in gross domestic product ( gdp ) was likely to speed up slightly in sweden and finland in 1987 and 1988 , while declining in denmark and norway . iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained and balanced non - inflationary growth , the oecd said .

fall in canadian budget deficit to slow finance minister michael wilson said tax reform will not affect his determination to reign in expenditures , but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline in the budget deficit in the late 1980s . " responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible , " wilson said in a speech prepared for the house of commons . wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs in the year ending march 31 , 1988 , the same level as he forecast in the february budget . and in the year ended this past march , the deficit was expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32 billion dlr shortfall originally forecast , wilson said . wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year higher - than - anticipated spending , particularly in farm income support programs , will be offset by higher - than - anticipated revenues . but finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and 1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system . the deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1 billion dlrs in 1991 . wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the canadian economy , forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct this year and 3.0 pct in 1988 . in 1986 the economy grew by an actual 3.1 pct . inflation , meanwhile , is expected to stabilize at around the current four pct level over the next two years .  
u.s. economy slowdown raises recession fears the economy faces lackluster growth and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement in u.s. exports should falter , economists say . growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up , they say . " these factors raise the question : is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession ? " said lyle gramley , chief economist of the mortgage bankers association and a former federal reserve board official . the commerce department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter , but a u.s. monetary official called it a weak report . housing starts fell 2.7 pct in may , and consumer spending rose a weak 0.1 per cent . " our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing -- are faltering , but exports are picking up some of the slack , " martin mauro , senior economist for merrill lynch economics , told reuters . gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages . to offset this , u.s. exports must continue to rise , returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption , he says . " i expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening , but it is a close call , " gramley said . federal reserve board governor martha seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia . seger said that with the recovery stumbling along , " the pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy " - possibly a signal that the fed will be accommodative . most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly , higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession . mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in may came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry , where an inventory overhang still exists . he says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper , chemicals , and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar . " they are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity , but i think they will keep us out of a recession , " mauro said . in a speech to financial planners this week , beryl sprinkel , the chief white house economic adviser , predicted the trade deficit will continue

canada economy expected to grow moderately canadian economic growth is expected to slow further in 1987 , but an improved the trade picture should keep the country from recession , economists said . " the economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth over the course of 1987 , " said carl beigie , chief economist at dominion securities pitfield ltd. statistics canada reported that gross domestic product , grew 3.1 pct in 1986 , the fourth year of continuous expansion , but down from 1985 's four pct . in the final quarter , gdp , in 1981 prices and at annualized rates , rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the third quarter .

" " we were n't surprised , we expected to see one bad quarter in canada , but we do n't think there will be a recession , " she added . the rise in gdp was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by federal finance minister michael wilson in his budget last month . he also projected the economy would expand   2.8 pct this year . many economists are less optimistic , predicting growth will likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range . statistics canada also reported the country 's trade performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion canadian dlrs from the previous year 's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs . " the sharp increase in the deficit originated from merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged , " the federal agency said in a statement . the merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985 . but economist cork said the expected upturn in the u.s. economy will lead to increased demand for canadian goods , and help fuel the country 's modest expansion . nearly 80 pct of canada 's exports are shipped to the u.s. each year .

finance ministers agree on need for stability finance ministers from seven major industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth . in a communique issued after a four - hour meeting at the u.s. treasury that ended last night , the ministers said the value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct now , and they welcomed new measures planned by the japanese to boost their economy . west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg called it a " good meeting " and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome . shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in tokyo , the bank of japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly . the communique said , " the ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent paris meeting . they agreed , however , that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures , sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances . " it welcomed the plans set this week by the japan 's ruling liberal democratic party to stimulate its economy with what the communique termed " extraordinary and urgent measures " including an " unprecedented front - end loading of public works expenditures . " the meeting of the so - called group of seven brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies , the united states , japan , west germany , france , britain , italy and canada . the communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on february 22 in paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the then - current levels . in the weeks that followed , the dollar continued to fall against the japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the bank of japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows . japan has come under growing criticism from both the united states and european countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports . the communique said japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate . it said the officials " reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the louvre meeting .

" as i said at a time of louvre ( agreement ) , the expression of ' current level ' is rather vague idea , " he said . the yen 's movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in paris in febraury , he said . it was better to give a vague expression than pin - pointing a level , which could have an adverse impact on the market , miyazawa said . asked why only japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement , he said japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable . he also said japan 's ruling liberal democratic party has justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short period since the paris agreement . miyazawa also said the u.s. sanctions against japanese semiconductor products was not discussed through the g-7 meeting and did not affect the currency talks . the seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative outlined by u.s. treasury secretary james baker 18 months ago .

treasury 's baker says floating exchange rate system needs greater stability   treasury 's baker says floating exchange rate system needs greater stability  
treasury 's baker says system needs stability treasury secretary james baker said the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances from emerging in the global economy . in remarks before the afternoon session of the international monetary fund 's interim committee , baker said he was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned . " but i do suggest , " he said , " that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts . " he said that indicators can serve " as a kind of compass " but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies . baker , however , said the imf " needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today . " the treasury secretary said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- article iv consultations -- that the fund performs . baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the imf to adopt earlier recommendations making imf surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public . " in particular , we urge increased publicity for imf appraisals developed in article iv consultations , the use of follow - up reports on country actions to implement imf recommendations , and greater use of special consultation procedures , " he said . baker emphasized that indicators were a device " for moving beyond rhetoric to action . " he said they provide " more structure to the system , and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination . " he said the fund 's procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators . " this should be matter of priority for the executive board , " he said . baker also urged the fund to develop alternative medium - term economic scenarios for countries that " can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances , by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options . " he said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium - term objectives . " if we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course , then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables , " he said .

antibiotics in feed aid deadly bacteria : study a study of salmonella poisoning has uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that can infect humans and resist medicines . researchers at the federal centers for disease control tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote the growth of cattle . cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster . but critics have been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs . industry officials have disputed this , saying the diseases that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect humans . but the new study , reported in thursday 's new england journal of medicine , shows the diseases can spread to humans . the research team , led by dr. john spika , said the number of people who have developed the chloramphenicol - resistant infection in los angeles county alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to 298 the following year . two of those victims died and half the victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized for their illness . they also discovered that cooking the meat did n't always prevent the disease . only 15 pct of the victims reported eating raw , infected hamburger . thus , the researchers concluded , " the majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating hamburger that was at least partially cooked . " the researchers said the results show that " food animals are a major source of antimicrobial - resistant salmonella infections in humans , and that these infections are associated with ( antibiotic ) use on farms . "

" the ministry of agriculture is concerned about the possible effects on human and animal health , " the official said . the government is also studying a recommendation from the farm animal welfare council ( fawc ) to restrict the trade of calves under 56 days old through markets . the fawc says this would help reduce the spread of salmonella .

fed 's heller sees return to slower money supply growth   fed 's heller sees return to slower money supply growth  
fed 's heller says monetary growth to be slower robert heller , a member of the federal reserve board , said he expects " more modest levels " of growth in the money supply this year . " in my view , this would not only be a logical , but also a most desireable development , " he said in a speech prepared for delivery to an economic forum at chapman college in orange , calif. a text was released in washington . he said the effect of lower inflation and financial deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished . " consequently , monetary growth may return to more modest levels , " heller said . he noted growth in the money supply slowed after mid - january . " i would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as well , " he added . heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation . " the pricing behavior of american producers in response to price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial for our economic future , " he said . widespread domestic price rises in response to rising import prices would " generalize the inflationary forces emanating from the foreign trade sector " and might not gain more market share for u.s. producers . " a return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be the result of such a behavior pattern , " heller warned . he said " we at the federal reserve will have to be disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy . " heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather than new taxes . " the imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in international markets , " heller said . he said the u.s. economy should expand by nearly three pct during 1987 , aided by higher exports to europe and canada . a free trade agreement currently being negotiated with canada " would be exceedingly helpful in allowing american producers to compete more effectively in that country , " heller said .

" it 's clear that the fed has firmed somewhat . discount window borrowings , net free reserves , the fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with a modest tightening , " said dana johnson of first chicago corp. johnson , and several other economists , now estimate that the fed funds rate should trade between 6 - 1/4 and 6 - 3/8 pct . discount window borrowings in the week to wednesday were 935 mln dlrs a day , producing a daily average for the two - week statement period of 689 mln dlrs , the highest since the week of december 31 , 1986 , and up from 393 mln dlrs previously . moreover , banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion dlrs from the fed on wednesday - the highest daily total this year - even though unexpectedly low treasury balances at the fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the fed had anticipated . however , economists said it is almost certain that the fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week . they pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week . first , economists now expect m-1 money supply for the week ended april 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs , partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes . as banks ' checking - account liabilities rise , so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the fed . required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended wednesday , but economists said the fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected m-1 surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late . second , an apparent shortage of treasury bills apparently left wall street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the fed , economists said . thus , although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos outstanding on wednesday night , the fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so . " it 's not at all inconceivable that the fed did n't add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral , " said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch economics inc. mccarthy estimated that the fed is now targetting discount - window

talking point / steel companies steel stocks , which have had a healthy runup recently , still present some short term investment opportunities , according to some steel analysts . but others say the upturn , based on strong orders and firm prices this spring , has been strictly seasonal and will end soon . they recommend taking profits . " it 's that time of year . this is strictly seasonal , " said charles bradford of merrill lynch and co. " orders will be strong for about two months , and there are signs that some ( order rates ) are starting to dive already . " but dean witter reynolds inc analyst clarence morrison sees some short - term potential in the group , which includes usx corp & lt;x > , bethlehem steel corp & lt;bs > , armco inc & lt;as > and inland steel industries inc & lt;iad>. " there is still some attractiveness to steels over the short- to intermediate - term based on improved order rates and rising prices , " morrison said . he only recommends one stock , however , inland , which is modernizing steelmaking operations to make them more efficient . despite his bearishness , merrill 's bradford continues to recommend armco , which he sees as a major turnaround . armco 's steelmaking operations are profitable , the balance sheet has been improved , and its oilfield equipment business has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with usx , bradford noted . " it 's not a high - quality investment situation yet but they 've come a long way , " he said . " we think the stock will do moderately better than the market , " he said . armco shares , trading off 1/4 at 10 today , could go to 12 , and possibly as high as 15 , he said . bradford sees armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987 , before special gains from recouped investment tax credits , against losses last year . armco 's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher , he said . bradford is recommending sale of usx shares . " we had a buy on it below 20 but when it gets to 28 , let somebody else have it , " he said . the steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a share in 1987 , about half of that coming from asset sales , and from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988 , bradford said . " but a lot depends on oil prices , " he added . about 60 pct of usx 's sales come from oil and natural gas . other analysts , including michelle galanter applebaum of salomon brothers inc , recommend usx . " the company 's done a lot ( of restructuring ) , more than the market 's given them credit for , " she said .

ec ministers consider cutbacks in steel support a new steel quota system that would strictly limit european community ( ec ) support to the industry could be forced on producers if they fail to find their own solution quickly , officials said . ec industry ministers meeting here considered two key proposals aimed at cutting back surplus capacity by 30 mln tonnes by 1990 . the first would limit the current quota system , which has protected ec output for seven years , only to flat products and heavy sections , thereby forcing other types of steel products into free market competition . the second proposal would link continuation of a quota system with progress toward plant closures , although less than a month ago the ec steelmakers ' lobby group eurofer said they had abandoned efforts to close plants voluntarily . the ministers stopped short of imposing their own solution immediately , instead urging steel producers to try again to reach agreement on voluntary cutbacks . the ec commission has said it will come up with detailed proposals in july on the future of the ec steel industry and ec industry ministers meet again in september to reach a final decision .

ec commission given plan to save steel industry european community steelmakers presented the executive commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept . under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming - down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand . industry commissioner karl - heinz narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by december 1988 . he has proposed a return to the free market , which under ec law is supposed to exist except in times of " manifest crisis . " but diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on march 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries , with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red . ministers from the ec 's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from narjes ' proposals and could back the industry 's own plan instead , in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures , they said . industry sources said the plan presented to narjes by the ec steelmakers ' lobby group eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990 . eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a " voluntary " basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year . cuts were still insufficient in one production area , that of hot rolled coils , and further talks were needed . eurofer added the industry would need the support of the commission and governments in carrying out a closure program , particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments . the ec steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes .  
nigeria , guinea set up iron ore firm with liberia nigeria and guinea agreed to set up a new company with liberia to carry out the 14-year - old mifergui - nimba iron ore project , an official communique said . the communique was issued after two days of talks here between guinean natural resources minister ousmane sylla and nigerian minister of mines and power bunu sheriff musa . originally , guinea held 50 pct in the project and nigeria 16.2 pct with firms from several other countries also involved , but the project ran into problems over funding and the slump in world iron ore markets . musa said liberia was invited to join and its share will be decided after a project feasibility study . this would be completed in may after which finance will be sought . officials said the study will be undertaken with the help of the world bank , which is also expected to give financial support . production , originally estimated at 15 mln tonnes a year , will be 12 mln initially and is expected to begin in early 1990 . on an agreement between the two countries to prospect for uranium in guinea , the communique said musa and sylla agreed that because of poor market conditions , it would be extended to cover exploration for gold , diamonds , cobalt , nickel and silver .  
india and japan to discuss iron ore prices the state - owned minerals and metals trading corp will send a team to japan next week to negotiate an iron ore export contract for 1987/88 beginning april 1 , trade sources said . japan , the biggest buyer of indian iron ore with imports of around 23 mln tonnes a year , has asked india to reduce prices from the current average of 18 dlrs a tonne , the sources said . " japan has said it may be forced to reduce ore imports from india next year if new delhi fails to reduce the price , " one source said , but declined to give further details .  
ussr to cut coal price for japanese steelmills the soviet union has agreed to cut its coking coal export prices to japanese steel mills by about five dlrs a tonne in 1987/88 starting april 1 in exchange for an increase in export volume , industry sources said . the prices were set at 44 dlrs a tonne for neryungrinsky coal and at 43.80 dlrs for kuznetsky coal , fob . japan will import a total of 4.9 mln tonnes from both areas , up from 4.2 mln a year earlier , they said . the steelmakers had asked moscow to agree to a cutback to 3.7 mln tonnes in 1987/88 , but the soviet union urged japan to increase the amount to 6.5 mln , they said .  
nippon steel , inland discussing u.s. joint venture nippon steel corp & lt;nstc.t > and & lt;inland steel co > of the u.s. are negotiating to set up a joint steel venture in indiana , a nippon steel spokesman said , declining to give more details . several local newspapers reported the joint venture would be capitalised at 150 mln dlrs , owned 60 pct by inland and 40 pct by nippon steel , and have annual production capacity of one mln tonnes of steel to supply car makers .  
ec commission has open attitude on steel quotas the ec commission said it was adopting an " open attitude " about whether a system of production quotas should remain for the indefinite future on heavy steel products which account for about 45 pct of all ec steel goods . in a statement , the commission reiterated its view that the industry needs to lose between 25 and 30 mln tonnes of capacity by 1990 . it had previously said the quota system , started in 1980 , should be wound up completely by the end of next year . the industry has argued for the maintenance of existing quotas , which cover almost 70 pct of all output , saying almost all steelmakers are losing money due to the depressed market .  
yugoslav 1990 steel output to hit 6.3 mln tonnes yugoslavian steel output will rise by one mln tonnes to 6.3 mln tonnes a year between 1986 and 1990 under a development program adopted by the yugoslav iron and steel metallurgy association , the official tanjug news agency said . the association groups together the main yugoslav iron and steel enterprises . extraction of iron ore should show an annual growth rate of nine pct and reach seven mln tonnes by 1990 under the program . iron output is planned to grow at eight pct a year , reaching 4.5 mln tonnes at the end of the decade . tanjug said the programme would create conditions for raising exports of finished steel products . the main yugoslav steel producers plan to market 5.35 mln tonnes of steel goods this year , or 150,000 tonnes more than last year , with 1.5 mln tonnes going to export .  
taiwan steel firm sees lower exports , more output state - owned & lt;china steel corp > said its steel exports will drop to some 600,000 tonnes in the year ending june 30 , 1987 from more than 810,000 in 1985/86 . production by the company , taiwan 's largest steel maker , is expected to rise to 3.33 mln tonnes from 3.27 mln , a spokesman told reuters . he attributed the export decline to the rise in the taiwan dollar , which has eroded the competitiveness of the company 's products against those from south korea . the spokesman said the company is undergoing an expansion project which calls for a boost in production to 5.65 mln tonnes a year from the current level . the project , costing 52.3 billion taiwan dlrs , will be completed by april 1988 , two months ahead of the targetted date , he said . the spokesman said the company exports its products to japan , southeast asia , hong kong , the u.s. , the middle east and africa .  
asian exporters fear damage from u.s.-japan rift mounting trade friction between the u.s. and japan has raised fears among many of asia 's exporting nations that the row could inflict far - reaching economic damage , businessmen and officials said . they told reuter correspondents in asian capitals a u.s. move against japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the u.s. and lead to curbs on american imports of their products . but some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt them in the long - run , in the short - term tokyo 's loss might be their gain . the u.s. has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of japanese electronics goods on april 17 , in retaliation for japan 's alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost . unofficial japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes . " we would n't be able to do business , " said a spokesman for leading japanese electronics firm matsushita electric industrial co ltd & lt;mc.t>. " if the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports ( of goods subject to tariffs ) to the u.s. , " said tom murtha , a stock analyst at the tokyo office of broker & lt;james capel and co>. in taiwan , businessmen and officials are also worried . " we are aware of the seriousness of the u.s. threat against japan because it serves as a warning to us , " said a senior taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named . taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year , 95 pct of it with the u.s. the surplus helped swell taiwan 's foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs , among the world 's largest . " we must quickly open our markets , remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of u.s. products , if we want to defuse problems from possible u.s. retaliation , " said paul sheen , chairman of textile exporters & lt;taiwan safe group>. a senior official of south korea 's trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the u.s. and japan might also lead to pressure on south korea , whose chief exports are similar to those of japan . last year south korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the u.s. , up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985 . in malaysia , trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against japan might allow hard - hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the u.s. in hong kong , where newspapers have alleged japan has been selling below - cost semiconductors ,
japan given little hope of avoiding u.s. sanctions a top u.s. official said japan has little chance of convincing the u.s. to drop threatened trade sanctions , despite the efforts of a japanese team that left for washington today . michael armacost , under secretary of state for political affairs , was asked at a press conference whether japan 's moves to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could persuade the u.s. not to impose tariffs on japanese imports said , and replied : " ... it is probably too early for the figures to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to permit the result you have described . " armacost said the u.s. hopes japan will take steps to lift its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports , remove barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues . " there are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area , but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on security and political issues , " he said . " the question is whether through cooperative actions between our governments we can reduce the ( trade ) imbalance or whether congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist legislation , " he said .  
japanese official takes data to microchip talks ministry of international trade and industry ( miti ) vice minister makoto kuroda leaves for washington today with data he hopes will refute u.s. charges japan has violated a pact on microchip trade . a three - man japanese trade team is already in washington laying the groundwork for talks between kuroda and deputy u.s. trade representative michael smith aimed at persuading the u.s. not to impose tariffs on certain japanese products . but kuroda said he is taking no new proposals . " i have nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current situation , " kuroda told the daily newspaper asahi shimbun . kuroda said the u.s. decision was based on incorrect data and an exaggerated sense of miti 's power to control market forces . " the u.s. has excessive expectations . to stabilise supply - demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time , " he said . kuroda also laid part of the blame for low u.s. chip sales in japan on a lack of effort by american firms here . he said if he fails in talks tomorrow and friday to forestall sanctions , he will seek further talks with u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter . u.s. officials said this week 's talks are unlikely to delay imposition of tariffs .

japan in last - ditch effort to avert tariffs senior japanese officials tomorrow open talks with american trade negotiators in a last - ditch effort to avert new high u.s. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of japanese electronic exports . makoto kuroda , vice minister of japan 's ministry of international trade and industry ( miti ) , is to hold two days of meetings with the deputy u.s. trade representative , michael smith , and the under secretary of commerce , bruce smart . the new tariffs , to go into effect on april 17 , are in retaliation for japan 's failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to u.s. semiconductor shipments . they are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors , including television and audio equipment and computers . both u.s. and japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of japanese shipments . president reagan announced the planned tariffs on march 27 after he said that close monitoring of the july 1986 u.s.-japanese semiconductor pact convinced u.s. officials that japan was not honoring the agreement . in making the annoucement , reagan said " i am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide american industry with free and fair trade . " trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at japan 's semiconductor trade practices , which are said to have injured the u.s. semiconductor industry , as congress , which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues . congressional democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been reagan 's inaction to redress the growing u.s. trade deficit , which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs . about one - third of the deficit was with japan . reagan said there were recent signs japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it . kuroda said on leaving tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation . he told the daily newspaper ashai shimbun that reagan 's decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of miti 's power to control japanese traders . " the united states has excessive expectations . , " he said . to stabilize supply - demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time . " he also said that u.s. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the japanese market .  
white house standing firm on japanese sanctions presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said u.s. trade sanctions against japan were likely take effect on april 17 in spite of a " full court press " by japanese officials to avoid them . " all indications are they will take effect , " he said . " i would say japan is applying the full court press ... they certainly are putting both feet forward in terms of explaining their position , " fitzwater told reporters . he noted high level meetings on the trade dispute are underway here but said , " i do n't think there 's anything i can report and i do n't believe there 's been any official movement . "  
white house says japanese tarriffs likely the white house said high u.s. tariffs on japanese electronic goods would likely be imposed as scheduled on april 17 , despite an all - out effort by japan to avoid them . presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater made the remark one day before u.s. and japanese officials are to meet under the emergency provisions of a july 1986 semiconductor pact to discuss trade and the punitive tariffs . fitzwater said : " i would say japan is applying the full - court press ... they certainly are putting both feet forward in terms of explaining their position . " but he added that " all indications are they ( the tariffs ) will take effect . "  
deficit cuts seen unable to cure trade deficit financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year 's federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the u.s. trade deficit or buoy the economy . the house of representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion - dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs . similarly , the senate budget committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year . " in terms of the economy , 37 - 38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal , so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit , " said stanley collander , a touche ross federal budget policy analyst . " at best , it will have a small positive effect , " collander said in an interview . federal reserve board chairman paul volcker has repeatedly told congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar . the u.s. government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar . but volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar 's value is fraught with danger . such a decline , he has said , could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit . in addition , in february , u.s. officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels . as part of that agreement , japan and west germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the united states agreed to cut its budget deficit . the alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit , volcker said recently , is to reduce u.s. consumption , particularly federal spending . " if you do n't deal with the budget deficit , everything else you do is going to be counterproductive , " volcker said in recent testimony before the senate banking committee . volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government 's purse strings than have the fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the united states . analysts say that fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession . kemper financial services economist john silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none . but he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to

canada trade rise seen as start of recovery canada 's trade picture has brightened considerably , underscoring economists ' predictions the sector would post a long awaited recovery this year . the federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 1.25 billion canadian dlrs in february , double january 's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than february 1986 's 189 mln dlr tally . " hopefully it 's the beginning of a trend , " said richardson greenshields of canada ltd economist susan clark in toronto . economists generally do n't expect such large gains over the next months , but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year . " we thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year , and it certainly looks as if this morning 's figure is indicative of that , " commented economist james donegan at the toronto securities firm of midland doherty ltd. statistics canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion dls in the month . " recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5.9 pct in february , " the agency said in its monthly report . total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85 billion dlrs in february , while imports slipped to 9.19 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs . economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year 's dismal 10.1 billion dlr total . in 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion dlrs . money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the canadian dollar , which rose to 76.85 u.s. cts on north american markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts wednesday . the currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading . economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish canadian economy . money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the canadian dollar , which rose to 76.85 u.s. cts on north american markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts wednesday . the currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading . economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish canadian economy . they say the country 's consumers , who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years , will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country . meanwhile , demand for canadian exports in the united states , by far the country 's largest market , is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in american consumer spending and the relatively low value of the canadian currency .

japan warns u.s. it may retaliate in trade dispute japan warned the united states it may take retaliatory measures if the united states imposes its planned trade sanctions on april 17 , a senior government official said . shinji fukukawa , vice minister of the international trade and industry ministry , said in a statement japan would consider measures under the general agreement on tariffs and trade and other actions if the united states imposes 100 pct tariffs on some japanese exports as planned next week . however , fukukawa said japan was ready to continue trade talks with the united states despite its failure to convince america to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in washington yesterday . last month president reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called japan 's failure to honour a july 1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the united states and to open its home market to american goods . fukukawa said the united states had regrettably not listened to japan 's explanation of its efforts to live up the pact and said washington had not given any detailed explanation of why it planned to impose the tariffs .  
taiwan announces new round of import tariff cuts taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade talks with washington which officials described as a move to help balance trade with the united states . wang der - hwa , deputy director of the finance ministry 's customs administration department , told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by washington . " the move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners , particularly from the united states , " he said . he said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics , bicycles , apples , radios , garments , soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and 50 pct . the cabinet was expected to give its approval next thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on april 20 , he added . taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700 foreign products last january aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the united states , the island 's largest trading partner . washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade deficit with taipei . washington 's deficit with taipei rose to a record 13.6 billion u.s. dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985 . it widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year earlier , taiwan 's official figures show . today 's announcement came before a departure later today of a 15-member taiwan delegation for washington for a series of trade talks with u.s. officials . the delegation 's leader , vincent siew , told reporters last night he was leaving with " a heavy heart , " meaning that he would face tough talks in washington because of rising protectionist sentiments in the u.s. congress . taiwan 's 1986 trade surplus with washington was the third largest , after japan and canada . siew said the talks , starting on april 14 , would cover u.s. calls for taiwan to open its market to american products , purchases of major u.s. machinery and power plant equipment , import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property . " i am afraid this time we have to give more than take from our talks with the u.s. , " he said without elaborating .  
british minister says he warned tokyo of sanctions a british minister said he had given the japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against japanese companies if tokyo did not allow more access to its internal markets " and it was clearly understood . " corporate affairs minister michael howard said on his return from a visit to japan he thought the japanese were beginning to appreciate the need to be " fair and open " about access to their own markets . at an airport news conference howard denied opposition charges that his trip had been a failure because he had returned empty - handed . " i did what i set out to do . i was sent to deliver a clear message to the japanese government , and i delivered it very clearly , and it has been clearly understood . " howard said that under the financial services act the govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions against japanese companies and finance houses operating in britain . " it is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing operating licences . we can ban firms from certain countries from carrying out certain kinds of business , while allowing them to carry out other kinds . " " i hope we do n't have to use these powers , but i made it clear in japan that if our timetable is n't met , we shall use them . " he said it would be unfortunate if britain and japan became involved in a tit - for - tat exchange , adding that japan gained more than anyone else from an open trading relationship . " i think they are beginning to appreciate that if this relationship is to continue , it is very important for them to be fair and open about access to their own markets . " on the question of the british firm cable and wireless plc & lt;cawl.l > , which is trying to win a significant share of telecommunications contracts in japan , howard said he had told the japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case . he said there were signs of movement on the case . cable and wireless was due to take part in talks in japan next tuesday , he said . earlier this week british prime minister margaret thatcher said britain could not go it alone on sanctions against japan , but would have to coordinate action with its european community partners . community sources said after a meeting of trade officials yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a range of japanese goods to prevent diversion from united states markets if washington imposes trade sanctions against tokyo as it has threatened .

need for bigger allied force in gulf played down secretary of state george shultz said today that a boost in allied forces in the mideast gulf was not vital to protect shipping against attack but that possible allied contributions should be examined . asked if he saw the need for a greater military presence by the allies in the gulf , shultz told reporters , " not necessarily , particularly , so .

u.s. to protect only american ships u.s. military forces in the mideast gulf are under orders to protect only american flag vessels and occasional u.s. arms deliveries on other ships to " non - belligerent " states in the area , the pentagon said today .

" as we have said repeatedly , only american flag vessels are under our protection with the exception , on a limited case - by - case basis , of ships carrying our foreign military sales equipment to friendly , non - belligerent states in the region , " sims said . u.s. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a kuwaiti ship which sailed to bahrain with u.s. arms for bahrain and kuwait . but sims said washington had received assurances that the the arms would not be used elsewhere . he said kuwait , which is turning 11 oil tankers over to u.s. firms to fly the american flag and be protected by the u.s. warships , is not considered a belligerent despite iranian charges that kuwait is supporting iraq in the gulf war . kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated iranian attack . sims refused to say how the united states will beef up its seven - ship middle east task force in the gulf to protect the 11 kuaiti tankers . but pentagon officials said that additional ships and air cover are under consideration .  
last - minute opposition to gulf bill arises house speaker jim wright predicted passage of legislation requiring the reagan administration to provide congress with a report on its mideast gulf policy , but a last - minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and conservatives left the bill 's fate in doubt . the legislation was written in the wake of the may 17th iraqi missile attack on the u.s. frigate stark in the gulf , which killed 37 americans , and president reagan 's decision to protect 11 kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under u.s. flags -- effectively making them american ships . since the administration made known its reflagging plans , congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted , and some charged the policy could lead the united states into the 6 1/2-year - old war between iran and iraq . the house was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the democratic and republican congressional leadership and the administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on plans to meet the security needs of u.s. forces in the gulf . the resolution was expected to pass without controversy today in the house foreign affairs committee before the full house was to take up the bill . but in a surprise move , liberal democrats and conservative republicans on the committee joined in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution . liberal democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the bill implied consent to reagan 's policies .  
u.s. house passes gulf bill despite opposition the u.s. house of representatives approved a bill that requires the reagan administration to provide congress with a report on its gulf policy but does not place any restrictions on its actions . the bill passed 305 - 102 -- winning a necessary two - thirds of those voting -- despite a last - minute revolt by an alliance of liberal democrats and conservative republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose president reagan 's policies in the region . the legislation was passed in the wake of the may 17th iraqi missile attack on the u.s. frigate stark in the gulf , which killed 37 americans , and reagan 's decision to protect 11 kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under u.s. flags -- effectively making them american ships . the legislation -- supported by congress ' democratic and republican leadership as well as by the administration -- required defense secretary caspar weinberger to provide a report to congress , within seven days of enactment , on plans to protect u.s. warships and flag ships in the persian gulf . it did not , however , place any restrictions on the administration as it proceeds to reflag the kuwaiti ships and thus has no immediate effect on u.s. policy . the senate was expected to approve the legislation this week . the bill would then be sent to reagan for signature . supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a first step toward a greater congressional involvement in formulating policy . but democratic critics said the bill did not ask the administration to address tough policy questions in the report .

" it is a real snake pit at best and a powder keg that will blow sky - high at worst , " said wisconsin rep. toby roth .

spot tin easier on european free market spot tin on the european free market was indicated in the easier range 4,200 to 4,230 stg per tonne , for high grade metal in warehouse rotterdam , down 20 stg from yesterday 's afternoon kerb close . stability in sterling versus the dollar continued to apply pressure to a market which is coming close to testing a psychological chart support base at 4,200 stg , traders said . dealers said major consumers still need to cover their may and june requirements but are holding out for even lower offers . reported high grade tin business in london was confined to end april metal at 4,225 stg . small - scale spot business was reported by west german operators at 12.60 and 12.63 marks per kilo although the market was still being undercut by chinese material , which traded at one stage down to 12.54 marks per kilo , traders said .  
consensus seen on tin pact extension the quarterly session of the international tin council ( itc ) continued without formal agreement on an extension of the sixth international tin agreement ( ita ) , but delegates said it was apparent there was a general consensus the agreement should be prolonged . some delegations are still awaiting formal instructions from capitals , but informally most have indicated they favour an extension , delegates said . this afternoon 's session was used by delegates to seek further clarification on some of the issues involved , and to discuss internal matters . some sources were optimistic a resolution on an extension could be passed tomorrow but others suggested a special session would be convened to adopt the resolution after the association of tin producing countries meeting april 14 to 16 . the full council session resumes tomorrow at 1330 gmt after a european community coordination meeting at 1100 .  
tin traders ' response muted to kl futures market european free market tin traders made a somewhat muted response to plans for a kuala lumpur dollar - based tin futures market due to be launched in october . traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for japan and other south east asian tin interests although european traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current " free market " system which has been operating since london metal exchange , lme , tin trading ceased in october 1985 . dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries . there is also a view among european traders that , while the proposed kuala lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point , a market inaugurated by the malaysian government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable . some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the london metal exchange , but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding high court litigation actions have been resolved . spot tin prices on the european free market are currently around 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse rotterdam . over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten year low of 3,400 stg in march 1986 and rebounded to as high as 4,680 stg in december 1986 . this compares with 8,140 stg last paid when lme trading ceased in october 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350 stg traded for cash standard grade metal in june of that year . lme warehouse stocks are now near a two - year low at 28,065 tonnes , having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485 tonnes reached in february 1986 . traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supply / demand deficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes . analysts were predicting prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987 . however , the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to 4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in december . the decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers . there was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year . traders say the 15 itc creditor banks ' original tin holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved , and the bulk of material still available is being held by malaysian and japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal . some
itc contests use of documents as court evidence the international tin council , itc , intervened in a high court hearing in an attempt to prevent the presentation of internal council documents as evidence . the intervention in shearson lehman 's action against the london metal exchange over its " ring out " of tin contracts in 1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which the council is involved following the collapse of its buffer stock operations in october 1985 , itc delegates said . the itc 's case is being presented by professor rosalyn higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next week . court does not sit tomorrow . in essence the council is claiming that its status is similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can therefore not be used in an english court of law . the council ended its quarterly session today ahead of schedule . the meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrow when the european community 's legal advisers were due to attend , but delegates reviewed the progress of the various legal actions today . otherwise , the meeting was occupied with internal administrative matters , delegates said . the itc will continue to operate with a reduced staff after june 30 following the two year extension of the sixth international tin agreement . as well as dealing with the ongoing litigation , the council will continue with its statistical work and carry out some research studies , although staffing in the research department is being cut to one from two previously . at this week 's session the council elected philip sparkes of australia as first vice - chairman for the producing members and heinz hofer of switzerland as second vice - chairman for the consumers for the year from july 1 . future quarterly sessions are scheduled for october 5/7 and december 14/16 .  
thai smelter faces tin concentrate supply shortage thailand 's major tin exporter and producer & lt;thailand smelting and refining co > ( thaisarco ) said it may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because of insufficient supplies of tin concentrates from thai mines . local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales to thaisarco , a royal dutch / shell group & lt;rd.as > unit , to less than 20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonne average , commercial manager yoot eamsa - ard told reuters . he said the cuts resulted from a government decision to let the temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exported tin lapse on june 3 . the taxes , levied on the tin mines , rose to 4.4 pct this month from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year . the lower levels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aid the tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985 . yoot said thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet a large portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100 tonnes per day . as a result , he said , thailand could fail to fill some 3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated by the association of tin producing countries ( atpc ) for the year ending february 1988 . reduced tin exports this year could cause the atpc to allocate a lower quota next year , yoot said . the supplies shortage should prove temporary , however , because the thai cabinet is expected to review a mineral resources department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late this month , yoot said . the department said thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tin during january / may compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago .  
tin council allowed appeal on use of documents britain 's highest court has decided the international tin council ( itc ) can appeal over the use of itc documents in court actions . on november 2 the house of lords will decide if and to what extent itc documents , whether circulated or not , are admissible as court evidence . lawyers working in the legal tangle left from the october 1985 collapse of the tin market said this hearing is likely to last a few days . on wednesday the court of appeal will link the outstanding itc cases that have so far reached it and a single set of hearings could begin in early january , they added . the house of lords ruling on the use of itc documents will be referred back to the action by two shearson lehman companies against the london metal exchange although the underlying case is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988 . the court of appeal hearings include action between brokers and cases by brokers and banks against the itc and the member governments of the tin council . action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of the itc or and placing it into receivership will also be covered by the court of appeal legal schedule .  
atpc members find ways to curb tin exports mine and industry officials from most member states of the association of tin producing countries ( atpc ) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started march 1 , according to views polled by reuter correspondents . the plan to curb exports , agreed in january , is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16 . members of the seven - member kuala lumpur - based atpc account for some 65 pct of the world 's tin output . under the atpc plan , malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes , indonesia 24,516 , thailand 19,000 , bolivia 13,761 , zaire 1,736 and nigeria 1,461 . australia has said it is not setting any export quota . however , the tonnage allocated to it , 7,000 tonnes , is roughly equal to its expected output this year . comment from officials in zaire was unavailable . mine officials in malaysia , the world 's leading producer , said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started march 1 . chief inspector of mines redzuan sumun told reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one - year quota period would be kept in the national stock . mine owners in malaysia have welcomed the atpc export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences . more than 100 applications for licences are pending . redzuan said the mines department would approve new mining licences only if a six - month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing . atpc chairman and indonesia 's mining and energy minister subroto has pledged his country 's support for the export curb . a spokesman for the state - owned tin mining company pt tambang timah told reuters it would be easy for indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636 . in bangkok , thai industry minister pramual sabhavasu said thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices . to insure adherence , the industry ministry and sole tin exporter thailand smelting and refining co would encourage bigger stockpiles , and income tax exemptions would be permitted , he said . the thai mineral resources department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production , industry sources said . but mining industry council president dam teutong told reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo , thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines . thailand exported 18,367 tonnes
( rpt ) u.s. says tin disposals will not affect accord u.s. tin disposals should have little effect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing countries to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started march 1 , a government official said . the agreement by the seven - member association of tin producing countries ( atpc ) aimed to cut the world surplus and boost prices . following the accord , atpc chairman subroto appealed to the united states to restrict its tin releases from its strategic stockpile . " we do n't think that ( the u.s. government ) has a large influence in the ( tin ) market at this stage of the game , " said thomas o'donnell , director of international commodities at the state department . last year the united states released about 4,900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms .  
zaire accepts tin - export quota , atpc says zaire agreed to limit its tin exports to 1,736 tonnes for 12 months from march 1 in line with an association of tin producing countries ( atpc ) plan to curb exports , the atpc said . atpc executive director victor siaahan told reuters he received a telex from zaire indicating its willingess to take part in the plan to limit total atpc exports to 96,000 tonnes for a year from march 1 . siaahan said zaire is expected to produce 1,900 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987 , and that in 1986 its output and exports were about 1,200 tonnes . the atpc hopes to cut the 70,000-tonne world surplus by 20,000 tonnes and boost prices . all atpc members except zaire and australia recently agreed to adhere to the export quotas allocated them under the plan . australia said its quota of 7,000 tonnes was roughly equal to its expected output this year . the atpc consists of malaysia , indonesia , thailand , bolivia , australia , nigeria and zaire . china and bolivia , important producers of tin , are not members .  
thai tin exports rise in january thailand exported 1,816 tonnes of tin metal in january , up from 1,731 in december and 1,330 a year ago , the mineral resources department said . it said major buyers last month were singapore , japan , britain , the netherlands , malaysia and the u.s.  
bulletin says tin price may rise to 20 ringgit the tin price is likely to rise to 20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers ' accord on export quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sell the metal at lower prices , a malaysian government bulletin said . the malaysian tin bulletin said it is in producers ' interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to 90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes overhang . it said consumption by industrialised countries should stay at 160,000 tonnes and that international tin council creditors and brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively unless there is a large and abrupt price jump . the continued depreciation of the dollar could also help push up the price of tin , the bulletin said . a depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the ringgit which is closely pegged to it , making the price of tin cheaper in sterling terms , it added . " even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin market , psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a price recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo , " the bulletin said .  
bolivian tin miners start hunger strike about 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation comibol went on hunger strike to press for higher wages , a miners union spokesman said . victor lopez , executive secretary of the miners union , told a news conference the strikers began to fast in the major tin mining districts of oruro and potosi and the action would spread tomorrow to la paz and other areas . the government has charged that the strike by the miners union , crippled by massive layoffs , is part of a left - wing destabilisation plan to coincide with the visit of west german president richard von weizsaecker , who arrives on a four - day official tour on friday . but miners union chief simon reyes told reporters the strike had nothing to do with subversion and was to press for more government investment in comibol . the government of president victor paz estenssoro has streamlined the deficit - ridden state mining corporation laying off about 20,000 miners , two - thirds of the workforce , following a collapse of the international tin price in 1985 .

major tin centers paralysed bolivia union says a strike by 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation comibol has paralysed tin production in the major centers of huanuni , corocoro , siglo , catavi and colquiri , the conflicts secretary of the bolivian miners federation , cristobal aranibar , told reuters . the strike began at midnight to press demands for higher wages and more funds for the nationalised mining industry . the miners federation left the door open to negotiations with the government but " only if the authorities show their intention to find solution to our demands " , aranibar said . the government of president victor paz estenssoro , faced with mounting social unrest against its economic policies , has said the miners strike was part of a campaign to discredit it during the visit of west german president , richard von weizsaecker , who arrives today for a four - day official visit . the government froze salaries as part of its efforts to pull bolivia out of a deep economic crisis . according to central bank forecasts inflation will reach an annual 10 pct rate versus up to 20,000 pct in 1985 . in addition to the miners ' strike , about 1,000 railway factory workers of the bolivian labour organization ( cob ) began a second day of a hunger strike in the country 's main cities to press for substantial wage increases , a union leader said .  
economic spotlight - bolivia bolivia , once latin america 's most delinquent debtor , is preparing for a second international monetary fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending . a fund spokesman said an imf team would visit la paz shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement . he said the imf had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this month . the accord provided for a stand - by loan , a compensatory financing facility and a structural adjustment facility . the spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed , bolivia can expect a further 60-mln - dlr stand - by loan over the next 12 months . bolivia 's agreement with the imf , its first since 1980 , opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the paris club and argentina and brazil , which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of bolivia 's 4.0-billion - dlr foreign debt . central bank president javier nogales told reuters the negotiations with the paris club , which have yet to be finalised , had been extremely successful . nogales said the paris club had agreed to reschedule bolivia 's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988 . bilateral discussions on interest rates continue , he said . nogales said bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies , including the world bank and the inter - american development bank , although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs . nogales said bolivia 's net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs , up from one mln dlrs when president ictor paz estenssoro took office in august 1985 . nogales said the capital flow on bolivia 's debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986 . bolivia 's return from the financial wilderness follows paz estenssoro 's economic stabilisation program . he inherited inflation of 23,000 pct a year , state enterprises that were losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate . paz estenssoro froze public sector wages , set a market- related rate for the peso , introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations . inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months , according to the central bank , and the government expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years . the government is also proposing a novel solution to its debt to commercial banks , some 900 mln dlrs , on which
ec sugar tender hard to predict - london trade the outcome of today 's european community ( ec ) white sugar tender is extremely difficult to predict after last week 's substantial award of 102,350 tonnes at the highest ever rebate of 46.864 european currency units ( ecus ) per 100 kilos , traders said . some said they believed the tonnage would probably be smaller , at around 60,000 tonnes , but declined to give a view on the likely restitution . last week , the european commission accepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators protesting about low rebates . this might be a determining factor in today 's result , they added .

rain boosts central queensland sugar cane crop good rains of one to four inches in the past 10 days have boosted moisture - stressed sugar cane crops in the mackay - burdekin region of queensland 's central coast , an australian sugar producers ' association spokesman said . as previously reported , the region has been undergoing a severe dry spell , partly relieved by scattered rainfall , since december , following the virtual failure of the summer wet season . mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth since the rains began , the spokesman said from brisbane . although the mackay - burdekin crop outlook is much better than it was , there will be some cane losses , the spokesman said . but is too early to say what they will be and more rain is needed to restore sub - soil moisture . elsewhere , in far north queensland , the bundaberg region and southern queensland , the cane is in excellent condition and some mills are forecasting record crops , he said . initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled towards the end of may , he said . the cane crush normally runs from june to december .

dutch sugar beet planting half finished roughly half of this year 's expected 130,000 hectare dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground , a spokesman for suiker unie , the largest sugar processor in the netherlands , told reuters . conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around april 11 , against april 23 last year , and a 10-year average of april 14 , the spokesman added . " it is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in september , but at least the crop is off to a very good start , " he said . last year , the netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar , substantially more than the country 's combined " a " and " b " quota of 872,000 tonnes . this year , however , a self - imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non - quota " c " sugar produced . only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas . this is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar .

smuggling blamed for closure of haitian sugar firm a sugar mill which was this nation 's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday , saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from miami and the neighbouring dominican republic . the closure of the haitian american sugar company ( hasco ) will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to 40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital , the company said . " because of unprecedented and ever - growing smuggling , hasco regrets ... it can not continue to accept delivery of sugar cane after april 10 , " the mill warned planters earlier this week . since president jean - claude duvalier fled haiti fourteen months ago , widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking oil , flour , rice , sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers , throwing hundreds of thousands of haitians out of work . at the hasco compound , where grim - faced workers lined up to receive their last pay , spokesman georges d. rigaud showed a warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound ( 45-kg ) bags of sugar . " we are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar . we have no money left to continue operations , " rigaud said . he said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers . rigaud blamed the mill 's problems on an order by duvalier two years ago forbidding hasco from refining sugar . he said the government then began importing refined sugar at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and the provisional military - civilian government that replaced duvalier last year continued the policy .

china seen unlikely to raise sugar imports china will not increase sugar imports substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints and large stocks , despite falling production and rising domestic demand , traders and the official press said . " despite rapid increases in domestic production over the last 30 years , imbalances between supply and demand continue to be extremely serious , " the farmers daily said . it said 1986 plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives , because farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated . the official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop ( november / march ) at 4.82 mln tonnes , down from 5.2 mln a year earlier , and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year . the yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500 tonnes , the provincial daily said . it gave no year - earlier figure . output in guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes , the new china news agency said without giving a year - earlier figure . the nanfang daily said production in guangdong province fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the area under sugar was dropping . " supply of cane ( in guangdong ) is inadequate , " the newspaper said . processing costs are rising and the economic situation of nearly all the mills is not good . to guarantee supply of cane is a major problem . " a western diplomat said sugar output also fell n fujian , south china 's fourth major producer , where there was a drop in area planted . he said the rural sectors in guangdong and fujian were wel developed , enabling farmers to choose crops according to the maximum return , meaning that many had avoided sugar . the farmers daily said a peasant in the ortheast province of heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu ( 0.0667 hectares ) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only 70 from one mu of sugarbeet . the paper said the profit margin of mills in china fell to 4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980 . mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed with each other for raw materialsx , it added . this resulted in falling utilisation rates at big , mode{nised mills . the price of sugar had not changed in 20 years , the official press has said . customs figures showed china imported 1.18 mln tonnes of sugar in calendar 1986 , down from 1.9 mln in 1985 . the diplomat said stocks at end - august 1986 were 2.37 mln tonnes , up from 1.92 a year earlier . a foreign trader here said china accumulated large stocks in 1982 - 85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import sugar on their own authority . this practice was stopped in 1986 when
fiji makes sugar payment to get harvest started fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim payment on the 1986 crop , four months ahead of schedule , in a move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought - hit 1987 crop under way , governor - general ratu sir penaia ganilau said . industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop indicated output of 360,000 tonnes , well down on the record 501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 ( may - december ) crop year . the previous record was set in 1982 when fiji produced 486,790 tonnes . for the past month fiji sugar farmers have delayed harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the governor - general to demands following the may 14 coup . ganilau said in a statement the fiji sugar corp would make a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills by june 23 . crushing would commence at labasa and penang mills on june 23 and at lautoka and rarawai mills on june 30 , he said . the interim payment , to be made on or about june 30 , is the full amount of the grower 's share of 1986 sugar proceeds received to - date . the balance will be paid in october . growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of 23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to the mill , but this has been rejected by the state controlled fiji sugar corp , ganilau said . however , in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of 14.10 dlrs , an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs , or 10 pct of the forecast price , would be paid on december 15 , on all cane harvested by november 30 , he said . ganilau said , " this will be at least one month in advance of the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane . the balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the end of crushing . " another demand of fiji 's 22,000 small farmers was that an estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the fiji development bank ( fdb ) for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off . the fdb rejected this request . ganilau said , however , " the bank is prepared to carefully consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of hardship on a case - by - case basis . " in response to a further demand that all soldiers be removed from the cane growing areas , ganilau said the army would restrict its presence in the cane areas . he said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to harvesting gangs , cane growers and sugar industry trade unions to

scrap crepe rubber prices firat colombo auction scrap crepe prices firmed on good shortcovering demand at the colombo rubber auction , brokers said . one - x brown was traded at 19.75 rupees per kg , up 15 cents from last rates while other grades also showed improvements . the rise was attributed to a shortage of rubber available to manufacture this type . latex crepe prices were unchanged with the best one - x selling at 20.92 rupees . crepe one was traded at 20.68 and crepe two at 20.45 rupees . sheet was firm as in previous weeks with rss1 averaging 22.05 rupees against 22 previously . the total quantity of rubber offered at the sale was 320 tonnes .  
rubber stock manager says quality acceptable international rubber organisation ( inro ) buffer stock manager aldo hofmeister said tests had shown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable , but acknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it . " we have said all along that the rubber is holding up well from a condition and quality standpoint ... rubber stored in proper conditions does not deteriorate , " he told reuters in a telephone interview . the quality of buffer stock rubber sold since he entered the market in september would be discussed at an inro council meeting which opened here today , he said . tokyo traders said on friday they had little interest in buying rubber from the inro buffer stock because of possible poor quality . hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the " may - sell ' level of 232 cents per kg early last month . inro 's five - day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on october 16 . he said the quality of five to six - year old rubber in stock was uppermost in consumers ' minds . " we have received good interest for the rubber . i understand the japanese concern . many consumers want to try the rubber before they carry on buying , " he said . hofmeister said inro rubber was stored in 28 different locations in producing and consuming nations , adding all warehouses used were suitable for long - term storage . selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the past week to 10 days and this could reflect a " wait and see attitude " by buyers , he said . " consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts until they test out the rubber . if their tests are positiive , they are likely to buy more . " hofmeister said he could reduce the offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest but inro did not want to depress prices artificially . hofmeister declined to comment on japanese trade estimates that he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in kuala lumpur and new york since september . but he said japanese traders were in a position to have an idea of the quantity he had sold , noting that traders overall had put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes . the question of sales from the original 360,000 tonne buffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the council meeting which is scheduled to end on thursday . the current international rubber pact expires on october 22 . the deadline for the new pact 's start is january 1989 and hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during the interim period .

leaf disease hits sri lanka rubber a leaf disease affecting seven pct of sri lanka 's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and raise currently depressed prices , industry officials and researchers told reuters . about 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the rubber research institute ( rri ) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus " corenes pora " which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves . the disease was first discovered about six months ago . trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes . last year 's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000 tonnes . researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken . " the rri is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease , " an institute spokesman said . senior industry and research officials met yesterday at padukka , east of here , to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the state plantations corp and janatha estates development board . the two state - owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145,600 hectares . the rric 103 is a new clone propagated by the research institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting . only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low - yielding but older pbx malaysian clones . officials at yesterday 's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated . they declined to comment on other decisions taken . trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last december . " if there is a shortage of rubber , prices are bound to rise , " a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the soviet union said . rubber prices , particularly crepe , fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between december and march . the best crepe one - x traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo , averaged 19.75 at this week 's auction . sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period . quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in december because of wintering in early february in producing areas . over 550 tonnes were offered at this tuesday 's auction with the supply position showing improvements . trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions . " some factors , like less storage space from excess stocks , meant we could not

malaysia says rubber pact depends on consumers malaysia said the success of talks opening today on a new international natural rubber agreement ( inra ) depends on how flexible consumer countries are . rubber producer and consumer countries meet for 12 days in geneva from tomorrow to try to hammer out a rubber pact after they failed to reach agreement last november to replace the current accord , which expires next october . primary industries minister lim keng yaik said in a statement that malaysia wants to continue with a second inra and is prepared to accept modifications that would strengthen the present agreement . he said the second inra would allow for an orderly disposal of the accumulated buffer stock of 375,000 tonnes , since the market is now capable of absorbing such releases .  
rubber producers , consumers start new pact talks the chairman of the conference on a new international natural rubber agreement ( inra ) , manaspas xuto of thailand , said it was imperative to try to settle the main outstanding issues this week . the inra renegotiation conference , which resumed today under the auspices of the united nations conference on trade and development ( unctad ) , is scheduled to last until march 20 . xuto told delegates this session of the conference presented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but it had to be the last before the current accord expires in october . xuto said in his consultations with representatives of major exporting and importing countries over the last few months , " i have found a constructive attitude and willingness to be flexible on the part of all concerned . " " it is imperative that we try to settle the major outstanding issues in the course of this week , since a considerable amount of technical drafting work will remain to be completed . " he said he will immediately start consultations with producers and consumers . the last october negotiations collapsed in disagreement over buffer stock operations . consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls , aimed at preventing inra from following the collapse of the international tin agreement ( ita ) , were rejected by producers who argued for unchanged inra terms . the tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran out of funds to support prices . three previous rounds of talks between rubber producers and consumers for a new five - year pact ended without agreement . the inra , originally due to expire in october 1985 , was extended to october 1987 to facilitate renegotiation . wong kum choon , head of the malaysian delegation , said he was cautiously optimistic " that together we should be able to save inra and prevent it from being scuttled . " without inra , he added , prices of natural rubber would become more volatile . calling on delegates to show a sense of purpose and reality , he said , " there is no reason why we could not put aside differences and come up with a successor agreement . "  
rubber leaf disease seen affecting supply / prices the leaf disease corenes pora , which has affected some rubber trees in sri lanka and indonesia , is likely to force a cut in supply and push up depressed prices , a malaysian rubber disease researcher said . trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease can not be saved and must be felled , chee kheng hoy , head of the crop protection and microbiology division in the rubber research institute of malaysia ( rrim ) , told reuters . he was commenting on a reuter report which said corenes pora had hit seven pct of sri lanka 's plantations and may cause output to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes . the report said the sri lankan rubber research institute may ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by the disease and added that most estates affected belong to the state plantations corp and janatha estates development board . chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affects certain rubber clones in sri lanka and indonesia and that further use of such clones must be discontinued . clones not resistant to the disease are the rubber research institute of sri lanka clone 103 , indonesia 's ppn 2058 , 2444 , 2447 and pr 265 and malaysia 's rrim 725 , he said . chee said corenes pora affected trees from the rrim 725 clone planted in malaysia several years ago but had been curbed after use of such clones were discontinued . fungicide may be used to curb the disease , which also affects leaves of 30 other species of plants , but experience has proven that it is uneconomical and expensive , he added . " the disease is extremely difficult to control . if it is not curbed in the two affected countries their rubber output may drop and prices can rise , " he said . he added that the rrim was aware of the disease outbreak in sri lanka and was monitoring the situation .  
progress at rubber pact talks reported slow negotiators at a united nations conference on natural rubber are making slow progress towards reaching an agreement , delegates said . the conference , which began monday , is widely seen as the final effort to adopt a new international natural rubber agreement ( inra ) before the current one expires in october . some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two - week meeting . this is the fourth such conference in nearly two years . delegates said both sides still appeared divided on the key issue of the price adjustment mechanism . consumers want frequent price reviews at 12 month intervals instead of 18 months as at present , a proposal currently rejected by producers . and while consumers press for the price adjustment to be automatic , producers have resisted reducing the role of the international rubber organization council in the price adjustment procedure . conference chairman manaspas xuto of thailand has said it was " imperative " to settle outstanding issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week .  
rubber talks chairman cites slight progress there has been slight progress towards reaching a rubber pact , the chairman of a united nations conference on a new international natural rubber agreeement , inra , manaspas xuto of thailand , said . " there has been some slight progress but it is not the end of the road yet , " he said . the conference , which began monday , is seen as the last effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which expires in october . some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two - week meeting . xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings . at the beginning of the conference , the fourth such meeting in nearly two years , xuto said it was imperative to settle those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week . conference sources said it is highly unlikely that producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible downward adjustment of the floor price , as proposed by consumers under certain circumstances . the sources said this means that any possible adjustment would centre on the reference price , and the " may buy " ( or " may sell " ) and " must buy " ( or " must sell " ) levels without changing the " lower indicative price " ( or floor price ) of 150 malaysian / singapore cents a kilo in the present pact . the present five - day average of the indicator price is around 192 malaysian / singapore cents . consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price , set in the current accord at 201.66 malaysian / singapore cents a kilo , and of the " lower indicative price " if the buffer stock , currently 360,000 tonnes , rises to 450,000 tonnes . consumers want price reviews at 12-month intervals instead of the 18 at present , and the price revision mechanism to respond automatically to market trends . at present , if the market price has been above or below the reference price for six months , the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the international natural rubber organisation council . consumers say that , in these circumstances , the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more . producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact .  
new rubber pact appears in the balance negotiations on a new international natural rubber agreement , inra , are approaching the make - or - break point and prospects for a future pact appear to be in the balance , delegates said . manaspas xuto of thailand , chairman of the inra renegotiation conference , is holding consultations with a small group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major outstanding issues . when the talks began on monday xuto said those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to allow time to draft an agreement during the second week . the talks are due to last until march 20 . xuto said , " there is nothing concrete yet , but the atmosphere is good . " the discussions are expected to continue late into the night , and xuto said he may hold weekend meetings . delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to which price adjustments should be automatic . at present , if the market price has been above or below the reference price ( set at 201.66 malaysian / singapore cents a kilo in the current agreement ) for six months , the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the international natural rubber organisation council . consumers are asking that , in these circumstances , the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more . producers want the council to have the last word and have resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure . delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling another issue -- that of the floor price . it now appears that consumers may consider dropping their insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price , called the " lower indicative price , " under certain circumstances . this means that any possible compromise would centre on the reference price , and the " may buy " ( or " may sell " ) and " must buy " or " must sell " levels , without changing the " lower indicative price " -- which is set at 150 malaysian / singapore cents in the current pact . delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on the floor price question , producers may consider agreeing to another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews -- at 12 month intervals instead of 18 at present .

statoil seeks share in thai gas field norway 's state oil company den norske stats oljeselskap a / s ( statoil ) & lt;stat.ol > , has told thai authorities it is interested in taking a 30 pct share in a big offshore thailand gas field , statoil said . the field , in the southern sector of the gulf of thailand , is currently operated by u.s. oil company texas pacific oil co inc , a unit of canada 's seagram co ltd & lt;vo.n>. thailand 's state oil company & lt;petroleum authority thailand > ( ptt ) also holds a major stake in the field . ptt wants to develop the field and has asked statoil to consider co - development if the field 's licence is renewed . ptt , according to statoil , is currently negotiating with texas pacific to buy back the dallas - based oil company 's holdings in the field . " ptt must first sort out its problems with texas pacific . when this is done , we have said we are interested in taking over a 30 pct share in the field , " statoil spokesman willy olsen told reuters . statoil , hired by ptt to carry out an independent appraisal of the field 's reserves and propose a development plan , has estimated the field could be commercially developed at a cost of some 700 mln crowns . industry sources said texas pacific has submitted lower reserve estimates for the field than statoil and shown little interest in its development . statoil refused to disclose its upgraded reserve estimate for the field . the field 's reserves could be sold domestically through thailand 's gas distribution network or by converting the gas to electricity , the sources said . sources would not say which field statoil is considering .  
columbia gas & lt;cg > seeks contract cost recovery columbia gas transmission corp said it made an abbreviated , streamlined filing with the federal energy regulatory commission to recover a portion if its costs of renegotiating high - cost gas purchase contracts . recently , the columbia gas system inc pipeline subsidiary said , ferc denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a proposal to include these costs in the company 's most recent purchased gas adjustment -- or pga -- filing . noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial ruling , columbia gas said it would withdraw its alternative filing if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to include the contract renegotiation costs in its pga or consolidates this issue in the pipeline 's general rate filing and permit recovery , subject to refund , effective april one . the company said the alternative filing seeks to recover about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline 's non - gas sales commodity rates . this annual amortization amount is based on recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8 - 1/4 year period , beginning april 1 , 1987 . columbia gas said the filing would increase the pipeline commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln . the company said it orginially sought to include these costs in its pga since the payments to products resulted in almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were not related to take - or - pay buyout costs . it explained this interpretation was based on ferc 's april 10 , 1985 , statement of policy which said that only take - or - pay buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing under the natural gas act . as a result of renegotiating contracts for high - cost gas , columbia gas said , it has been able to reduce the average price paid for gas purchased from southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs per mln btu in december 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in april 1985 . the pipeline said southwestern producers account for 46 pct of its total available gas supply this year .

brooklyn union&lt;bu > seen hurt by pipeline closure brooklyn union gas co , a new york gas utility , will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of transco energy co 's & lt;e > decision to close its pipelines to transport spot gas sales , energy industry analysts said . brooklyn union , the fourth largest gas utility in the united states , purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot , or non - contract , market in 1986 , and the proportion of spot supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987 , analysts said . texas eastern pipelines & lt;tet > , the other competing pipeline , to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the south closed its gate station for summer , and brooklyn union has relied entirely on transco for spot supplies . in the month of may , brooklyn union paid about two dlrs per mln british thermal unit for spot gas , while contract gas costs four to five dlrs per mln btu , industry sources said . transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear of accumulating more take - or - pay liabilities . take - or - pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers . brooklyn union will continue receiving a small amount of supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause , a brooklyn union official said . foster corwith , gas analyst with dean witter reynolds , said most of the rising cost to booklyn union will be passed through to rate payers . while net effect on the company will not be known for several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings , end - users , especially residential and commercial customers , will end up paying more for gas , he said . because the closure takes place in summer months when gas demand is at seasonal low , the impact on cash flow would be small , curt launer , natural gas analyst with donaldson lufkin jenrette , said . if the situation persists into winter heating season , high cost gas could cut in the company 's profits , he said . gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on transco for spot gas , such as north carolina natural gas co & lt;ncng > , piedmont natural gas co & lt;pny > , will face the same high cost factor as brooklyn union , steve richards , a supply manager with end users supply system , a houston based natural gas brokering firm , said .

tenneco & lt;tgt > to transport gas on open access tenneco inc said tennessee gas pipeline co , its largest interstate natural gas pipeline , will transport natural gas under the open access rules of the federal energy regulatory commission , ferc . in open access , gas pipelines serve purely as a transport company , moving gas from suppliers to customers . pipelines also transport its own gas to customers . earlier this week , transco energy co & lt;t > rejected the ferc guidelines , saying it would not offer open access until the regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for gas it has bought but could not sell . the exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay contracts , under which pipelines bought gas on long - term contracts they could not sell . the problem grew severe as customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access . some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that tenneco might follow transco 's lead and close its pipelines to open - access because of the take - or - pay issue . but tenneco today said open access " is one of the steps ferc is taking to restructure the gas industry in the u.s. ferc is moving the industry through this restructuring now , even before all transitional problems are solved . " a spokesman said tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposure under the take - or - pay contracts , but he had no specific figure for tennessee gas , which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines from louisiana and texas up to new england . " we remain convinced that the most critical transitional issue facing the industry -- take - or - pay -- must be resolved by ferc in the near future . " a failure to do so could have grave consequences for the industry 's continued ability to provide its customers with reliable natural gas , " said tennessee gas transmission co president r.c. thomas .

lng imports from algeria unlikely in 1987 liquefied natural gas imports from algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its economically feasible , u.s. industry analysts sources said . youcef yousfi , director - general of sonatrach , the algerian state petroleum agency , indicated in a television interview in algiers that such imports would be made this year . " contract negotiations , filing with the u.s. government and the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay the import until 1988/1989 , " daniel tulis , a natural gas analyst with shearson lehman bros. said . sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former customers , panhandle eastern & lt;pel > and distrigas , a subsidiary of cabot corp & lt;cbt > to resume lng export , company officials told reuters . a third , el paso gas , a subsidiary of burlington northern & lt;bni > , has expressed no interest . industry analysts said some imports of algerian lng were feasible . " on a marginal cost basis , the companies that have made capital investment to handle lng import can operate profitably even in the current price environment , "   frank spadine , an energy economist with bankers trust , said . analysts did not forsee a major impact from algerian imports on u.s. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend higher by the end of 1987 . a decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring gulf of mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm prices , shearson 's tulis said . in this context , algerian lng import would be a source of supplemental supply to u.s. domestic production , he added . company sources currently in talks with algeria agree , saying that algerian lng would only serve to meet peak demand . company sources also said that any negotiations with algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate volumes to market requirements and prices to u.s. spot market values .

" ferc added that " specifically , in cases where pipelines assume an equitable share of buy - out or buy - down costs , the commission proposes to permit the pipelines to recover the remaining costs through their demand rates . " it said it wanted guidelines for buying out and reforming existing contracts to help spread the impact of these take - or - pay costs in a responsible , fair and equitable way . commission chairwoman martha hesse said " this proposal represents the commission 's sincere attempt to help the industry through this difficult period of transition to a more competitive market . " hesse said " it is my hope that our proposed policy will encourage and guide the timely resolution of take - or - pay contractual disputes that have impeded the industry 's transition to a more competitive environment .   it is vital to the industry that we get this problem behind us .

u.s. agency rules against brazil orange juice the u.s. international trade commission , itc , voted to authorize the commerce department to impose anti - dumping duties on imports of brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice . the itc voted 3 - 2 in favor of the anti - dumping petition in its final ruling on the matter . today 's itc ruling was consistent with the commerce department 's final ruling of march 9 , and activates an anti - dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice , stephen vastagh , itc investigator said . the itc found that brazilian orange juice imports have injured u.s. producers . the commerce department had already ruled that the imports were unfairly priced , and lowered to 1.96 pct the anti - dumping margin that in a preliminary decision last fall had been set at 8.5 pct , vastagh said . the u.s. government has been requiring bond to be posted on imports of brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice since commerce 's preliminary ruling of last october 23 , he said . commerce had ruled that one major brazilian producer -- cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti - dumping duty . brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total u.s. supply , vastagh said . between december 1985 and november 1986 , the united states imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons of brazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs , he said . currently , the united states requires a 35-cent per gallon tariff on orange juice imports , vastagh said . an itc spokesman said the agency would forward its final report on the anti - dumping case to commerce by april 22 . commerce then will process the anti - dumping order and transmit it to u.s customs , which will liquidate bond entries dating from commerce 's preliminary ruling and begin assessing duties , vastagh said . he said about 12 brazilian orange juice exporters , including three major shippers , would be affected by the decision .

fcoj supplies significantly above year ago - usda total supply of frozen concentrated orange juice ( fcoj ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly above year - earlier levels , even with carry - in stocks well below the previous season , the u.s. agriculture department said . in a summary of its fruit situation report , the department said florida 's imports of fcoj , mostly from brazil , have shown sharp gains to date . the department noted the price of fcoj will probably be affected by the final decision , scheduled for april 22 , on whether the u.s. considers brazilian fcoj exports to the u.s. have caused injury . continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier . the department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage at the beginning of february were moderately larger than a year earlier , but strong demand has kept apple prices firm . in view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced supplies , apple prices are projected to stay firm . during the remainder of 1986/87 , supplies of most processed noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago , it said . movement of canned fruit has improved , and remaining suppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a consequence prices have strengthened , the department said .  
cacex denies brazil fcoj price rise rumours there has been no rise in the price of frozen concentrated orange juice , fcoj , a spokesman for the banco do brasil 's foreign trade department , cacex , said . he was responding to rumours in the international market that brazil had raised its fcoj prices in range of 1,075 to 1,150 dlrs per tonne .

traders say usda may lower orange crop estimate the u.s. department of agriculture will probably decrease its estimate of the 1986/87 florida orange crop today to as low as 123 mln boxes from 129 mln boxes , analysts and industry sources said . the department is scheduled to release the new estimate at 1500 hrs est ( 2100 gmt ) today . analysts said the market is anticipating a downward revision and much of the bullish impact has been discounted . the estimate , which the usda has left unchanged since october , should be affected this time by recent evidence of a shortfall in the early and midseason crop now that those harvests are complete . analysts said based on earlier usda projections , the harvests should have been five to seven mln boxes larger than they were . " they are going to cut their estimate , " said bob tate , an fcoj broker with dean witter reynolds in miami . " the only question is whether they will admit the whole thing in this estimate . " tate said it is possible the usda will lower its estimate by a lesser amount , perhaps three mln boxes , and continue to drop the estimate in subsequent reports as the crop picture clarifies . the late season harvest , consisting mostly of valencia oranges , has not yet started , he noted . " they 'll temper it , " said judy weissman , fcoj analyst with shearson lehman bros. " the main drop will probably come in july . " she expects today 's estimate will be 126 mln boxes .

" there is nothing better than a free trade policy , " he said . cutrale and citrosuco officials were not immediately available for comment .

u.s. march retail sales cut by late easter u.s. retailers ' lackluster march sales were due to a late easter , according to analysts who expect a recovery in april . " sales look soft because of the easter shift , but underlying business is better than the numbers indicate , " said bear stearns analyst monroe greenstein . analysts generally average the sales results of march and april to account for the variation of easter 's occurance . this year , easter is being observed on april 19 , which is three weeks later than last year . analyst edward johnson of johnson redbook associates said sales for march rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct , and a seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct , compared to an adjusted 5.7 pct last year . " the obvious question is whether these numbers indicate that the consumer activity is slowing , but it does not appear to be because liquidity and employment are rising , " said analyst jeff edelman , analyst of drexel lambert and burnham . overall , analysts said first half sales are coming in according to expectations . sales for all of 1987 are expected to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct , up a bit from 1986 's rise . in march , sales of housewares , furniture and big ticket items were stronger than apparel sales , signaling to many analysts that apparel sales will be strong in april as the holiday nears . " sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a continuing strength in the housing market , " said edward brennan , chairman of sears roebuck and co & lt;s > which reported an overall sales gain of 4.2 pct . brennan said sales of women 's sportswear were also excellent . " sears ' total apparel sales was up only modestly , but even a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in april , " said c.j. lawrence analysts harry mortner . j.c. penney co inc & lt;jcp > and dayton hudson corp & lt;dh > were among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct , respectively . penney 's store and catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and dayton hudson 's overall sales rose 4.8 pct . penney chairman william howell said , " sales continued strong for catalog operations and , geographically , ranged from very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed southwest . " " penney 's been shifting away from leisure time activity wear to other apparel lines , which yield higher profit margins , but are currently hurting sales , " said greenstein of bear stearns . hudson chairman kenneth mackes cited the late easter for the decline . edelman of drexel said that " hudson had a tougher comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986
turkish retail prices rise 2.7 pct in february turkish retail prices rose 2.7 pct in february after 2.9 pct in january and 1.7 pct in february 1986 , the state statistics institute said . prices in the year to february rose 31.6 pct , compared with 30.3 pct in the year to january and 38.8 pct in the 12 months to february 1986 . the index ( base 1978/79 ) , covering 14 towns and five regions , was 1,886.8 in february , 1,837.2 in january and 1,434.0 in february 1986 .  
february u.s. retail sales not sign of upturn u.s. retailers posted stronger than expected sales in february , but not enough to prompt analysts to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the first half of 1987 . " my feeling is that it ( february ) borrowed some of the business we normally see later in the quarter and the real strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second half of 1987 , " said bear stearns and co analyst monroe greenstein . " i do n't think march will be as strong because easter falls in april this year , " said morgan stanley analyst walter loeb . analysts generally average the sales results of march and april to account for the variation of easter 's occurrence . analyst edward johnson of johnson redbook associates said sales for february rose between six and 6.5 pct , compared to a 3.6 pct increase last year . analysts noted that february is considered a small , transitory month between winter and spring . in addition , sales comparisons were boosted by an especially soft february last year which was adversely affected by severe weather . apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales , according to retailers and analysts . " february 's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to tax reductions , " said greenstein of bear stearns . analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing high levels of consumer debt . may department stores co & lt;may > and k mart corp & lt;km > were among the strong performers , posting comparable store sales gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct , respectively . may had an overall sales gain of 15.0 pct and k mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain last month . " favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs continued to positively impact our sales comparisons . in addition to the strong contribution by k mart stores , all our specialty retailing companies had excellent february sales , " said k mart chairman bernard fauber . sears roebuck and co & lt;s > posted a 4.9 pct increase . " domestic sales were led by better than average increases in apparel , home fashions and hardware and especially strong catalog sales , " said sears chairman edward brennan . analysts were a little disappointed by j.c. penney co inc & lt;jcp > which started out with especially strong sales early in the month . penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitive store basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales . penney chairman william howell said , " store sales were strongest during the early part of the month , while catalog demand was consistently strong throughout the period . store sales activity varied throughout the country , ranging from good in the east

u.s. retail sales rise masks weak trend - analysts u.s. retail sales rose sharply in february but many economists said the underlying consumer spending trend remains weak . february retail sales jumped 4.1 pct , more than the 2.5 - 3.0 pct rise the financial markets had anticipated . but january 's sales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop , from a previously reported 5.8 pct decline . " the trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a much more sluggish pace , " said don maude of midland montagu capital markets inc. maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data over past four months to show that the pace of consumer spending is slowing . combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in november and a 4.6 pct gain in december , the average retail sales gain over the four months was 0.2 pct , he said , compared to to a 0.4 pct rise for year - over - year sales through february . " you can see a pattern developing , " maude said . " i would n't be surprised to see a fall - off in march , especially since sales probably wo n't be boosted by auto sales as they were in february . " despite the weak underlying trend , economists were impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding autos in february . this compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline in january , previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline . " the increase in non - auto sales was broadbased , with gains in durable goods as well as non - durables , " noted ward mccarthy of merrill lynch capital markets inc. " it was a pretty healthy report . " he noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in february after falling 1.7 pct in january . general merchandise store sales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in january . " there are signs of life in the economy , " mccarthy said . " but it 's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report into the future . " a 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in january which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost spending in february , he said . " a lot of people may be inadvertently under - withholding taxes from their paychecks , " he said . " when people in this country get an increase in disposable income , the inclination is to go out and spend it , " he said . economists said tomorrow 's release of u.s. auto sales for the first 10 days of march will be an important indicator of how much this sector will add to first quarter spending . auto sales accounted for the lion 's share of total february sales , rising 14.4 pct . this followed a 27.7 pct drop in january ,

andriessen hints fats / oil tax could go to summit european community ( ec ) agriculture commissioner frans andriessen said his proposal for a tax of up to 330 european currency units per tonne on oils and fats was likely to go up for discussion at next week 's summit meeting of ec leaders . ec farm ministers have been unable to agree the tax , one of the main items proposed by andriessen for the 1987 - 88 farm price package . the tax , which would apply on both domestically - produced and imported oils and fats , has been fiercely opposed by the united states and developing countries ' vegetable and marine oil producers .  
acp states say ec oils tax plan breaks accords developing countries said the european community ( ec ) would breach two international agreements if it went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax . ambassadors to the ec from african , caribbean and pacific ( acp ) states told a press conference the tax would hit the exports of 26 acp countries . they said the ec failed to follow consultation procedures laid down in the lome convention which regulates relations between acp states and the bloc for moves which could affect trade between the two sides . they also said the ec would be in breach of an undertaking not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current punta del este round of world trade negotiations being held under gatt ( general agreement on tariffs and trade ) auspices . the ec commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 european currency units ( ecus ) a tonne on both imported and ec - produced vegetable and marine fats for human consumption , which could raise up to two billion ecus a year . ec farm ministers , who would have to approve such a tax , are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a marathon meeting on ec farm prices beginning in luxembourg on june 15 . jamaican ambassador leslie wilson said acp countries are convinced this would lead to ec industry substituting products made within the bloc for oil and fat imports . the acp estimates this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln ecus in its member country exports . " we ca n't believe the ec would willingly take measures to undermine our countries , but such would be the impact of these measures , " wilson said . the u.s. and malaysia say their exports would also be hit by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it is approved . wilson said the acp would take such steps only " as a very last resort , " but added that the acp is in touch with other countries which oppose the plan . wilson , who was chairing the news conference , made it clear jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not export oils and fats . among the worst hit countries would be ivory coast , senegal , nigeria and papua new guinea , the acp says .  
dutch parliament backs stand against oils tax dutch parliamentary parties have re - affirmed their support for the government 's opposition to the proposed european community tax on oils and fats , parliamentarians said . a broad cross - section of members of parliament voiced their opposition to the tax during a debate in the lower house yesterday on the basis of possible retaliation from the u.s. and on the potentially damaging effect on third world countries . state secretary for foreign affairs rene van der linden said the government was against the tax although it noted deepening ec financial difficulties . " it is difficult to be against the tax and against extra finance . the ec members have to make a choice , " van der linden said . however , he denied the government had dropped its opposition to the proposed tax or altered its position .  
rpt - opposition to ec oils tax intact - minister a minority group of european community countries strong enough to block the adoption of a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats is still intact after the ec commission proposed changes to its proposals earlier today , british agriculture minister john macgregor told journalists . he said britain , west germany , the netherlands and denmark continue to oppose the tax after the commission proposed making it temporary and promising compensation to any third countries whose exports suffered .  
dutch consumers / industry see veg oils tax threat dutch consumers and food processors would be hit hard by the proposed ec tax on oils and fats , dick de bruyn , chairman of the commodity board for margarine , fats and oils , mvo , said at the annual meeting . the dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine and fourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the ec . the fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers and steeply increase the costs of industries such as potato processing and cake and biscuit manufacturing , de bruyn said . " a move by these industries to countries outside the ec can not be ruled out , " he added . de bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be wide open to fraud , difficult to police , and hugely expensive administratively . he also said the proposed tax contravened not only article three of the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) , the lome convention , and the united nations food and agriculture organization ( fao ) guidelines , but also the ec 's own treaty . the proposed tax would not only be inflationary but also have consequences for employment and investment , he added .  
ec commission defends oils and fats tax a spokesman for the european community commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats , saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax . norbert tanghe , head of division of the commission 's directorate general for agriculture , told the 8th antwerp oils and fats contact days " the commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by community producers in the oils and fats sector ... would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy . " the proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable , tanghe said . recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion european currency units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0 billion ecus , he said . in 1990 the community 's " standstill " agreements with spain and portugal end and the ec would then feel the full impact of its enlargement . the commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system , he added . under the commission 's system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector , a reference price of 700 ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced , tanghe said . consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level . he said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the common agricultural policy 's oils and fats regime . " the commission believes that hostile reactions ( to the proposed tax ) have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal , " he said . tanghe said the proposed system conforms with general agreement on tariffs and trade , gatt , rules . it would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products , and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats . ec - produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements , he said . the competitiveness between different oils , whether ec produced or imported , would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax , tanghe said . the proposed system would not alter the ec nations ' requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise community production levels without affecting demand , he said . it is one of the proposal 's objectives to maintain current import levels , he said . imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the ec 's cakes and
ec presidency prepared to drop oils and fats tax belgium , current holder of the european community presidency , appears ready to drop a controversial oils and fats tax from this year 's hotly - contested farm price package , diplomats said . in a discussion document prepared for today 's summit meeting of ec leaders , belgium proposed the so - called " stabilising mechanism " be the subject of " further study and consultation with the community 's main trading partners . " the proposal for a tax of as much as 330 ecus per tonne on both imported and domestically - produced vegetable and marine oils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism . the discussion document , aimed at preventing a cash row at the summit and breaking the deadlock at this year 's farm price talks , contained the first formal reference to dropping the measure . britain and denmark , which assumes the ec presidency on june 30 , have led the opposition to the measure . they are supported by west germany and the netherlands and , to a lesser extent , spain . although the paper was not universally welcomed , diplomats said , the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for a further six months was certain to survive any redrafting .  
ec farm ministers to meet tomorrow after summit european community agriculture ministers will meet tomorrow evening , after the end of a two - day summit meeting of heads of government , to again attempt to agree a 1987/88 farm price package , an ec commission spokesman said . he added that tomorrow 's ec official journal will contain notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical nature which will come into effect on july 1 unless the ministers reach an accord . the spokesman declined to detail these special measures but said they would not be the sort of " dynamic " moves which ec farm commissioner frans andriessen has said he would take in the case of complete deadlock among farm ministers . these moves would be taken only if tomorrow 's meeting of ministers in brussels again fails to reach an accord , ec sources said . andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices by seven pct and to take other drastic action , trade sources said . ec farm ministers ended their last meeting on june 18 still split over the commission 's proposal for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats . in addition , west germany said it would veto plans for cereal price cuts and for a change in the green currency system . earlier today , diplomats said belgium , the current holder of the european community presidency , appears ready to drop the plans for the controversial oils and fats tax .  
franco - german parley fails to unblock farm talks a specially convened franco - german meeting in the sidelines of a summit of ec leaders failed to make any progress over a 1987 - 88 farm price package that has deeply split the two former ec allies , diplomats said the meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign ministers from both countries and by french president francois mitterand , his prime minister jacques chirac , and by chancellor helmut kohl of west germany . the stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to providing a solution to a long - term settlement of the community 's worst - ever budget crisis . " the germans clearly do not want to budge , " an aide to chirac told reporters . he added the french prime minister was visibly angered as he the hour - long meeting . bonn and paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for the brussels executive commission to overhaul radically the ec 's complex " green " currrency system , designed to translate common ec farm prices into national currencies . paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which west germany is against , along with britain , denmark and the netherlands . ec farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the package , which should have been agreed by an april 1 deadline tomorrow . diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have injected fresh impetus into those talks . the commission proposed its package to save one billion dollars on the ec 's ever - rising farm budget . the summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group , and plugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987 .  
lyng says india food aid package not ready the united states and india have not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the drought - stricken asian country , agriculture secretary richard lyng said . lyng told reuters in an interview that the two countries have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the specifics of the offer to be announced during indian prime minister rajiv gandhi 's visit here this week . " we have been talking about the potential needs that india might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs as well as the possibilities of assistance , " lyng said . " at this point , there is no detailed plan or program . the amounts of what commodities are uncertain . but we have indicated to the indians that we stand ready to assist in whatever way they deem most valuable , " he said . there has been speculation in trade circles that usda would offer india subsidized vegetable oil under the export enhancement program and donate surplus corn under section 419 of an amended 1949 law . lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree on the mix of concessional and commercial aid , and that washington would prefer the package include something other than donated food . " the indians are capable of purchasing a lot , of taking care of themselves . india is a country that has come a long way in its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in that , " lyng said . " we ( the united states ) obviously , with the surpluses we still have of many commodities ... , would like to share in the import business the indians do , and then we have some , as we always do , compassion for the people of india and would like to cooperate with them , " he said . lyng said he had no plans to meet with indian officials during gandhi 's visit here , adding , " i just do n't know of anything that might be announced specifically . " asked if " the ball was in the indians ' court , " he said , " yes . " gandhi is to leave washington tuesday evening .  
copa urges tax on vegetable proteins the european community 's farmers ' pressure group copa has urged ec farm ministers to agree a tax on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax which has already been proposed by the ec commission . copa president hans kjeldsen told a news conference on tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism for cereal substitutes . he was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the danish foreign and agriculture ministers , who currently chair meetings of their ec colleagues . kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help the ec 's budget problems and would provide some price stability for producers . this would in turn help the market position for certain crops of which the ec is a net importer such as oilseeds , peas and beans , but for which the commission is now proposing severe output restrictions . a minority of ec ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats succeeded in blocking the idea during this year 's annual ec price fixing . however , the ec commission has said it maintains its proposals for a tax . kjeldsen said copa had urged the ministers to pursue international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of bridging the gap between ec and world prices .  
oils / fats stocks seen falling sharply in 1986/87 visible stocks of 17 oils and fats are probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by october 1 this year , the oil world newsletter said . oil world forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season , compared with 10.6 mln a year earlier . its survey covered   13 oils -- soy , cotton , groundnut , sun , rape , sesame , corn , olive , coconut , palmkernel , palm , lin and castor   -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter , fish oil , lard and tallow / greases . oil world 's analysis predicted only a slight production increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end - september 1987 , compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the previous two seasons . it said world consumption was continuing to rise . unusually low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand for both food and non - food purposes , it said . world consumption   could increase by a record 2.8 mln tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher if the indian government did not artificially curb domestic demand . oil world said it did not expect the european community ( ec ) to introduce a vegetable oils tax , but if such a tax were introduced it would have a negative impact on ec consumption .
